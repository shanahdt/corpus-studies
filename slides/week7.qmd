## UFOs 

(example taken from Kurt, 2019)

- You are awakened by a bright light at your window. 
- You get out of bed and see a saucer-shaped object in the sky.
- Although you don't believe in aliens, you think to yourself "could this be a UFO?"

## UFOs 

1. You observed data
2. You formed a hypothesis
3. You updated your beliefs based on the data.


(example taken from Kurt, 2019)

## UFOs

- "The probability of observing bright lights outside the window and a saucer-shaped object in the sky is very low." Or:
  - $P$(bright light outside your window, saucer-shaped object in the sky) = very low

## UFOs

- The probability of observing bright lights and a saucer-shapd object in the sky, _given_ our experience on Earth, is very low. Or:
  - $P$(bright light outside your window, saucer-shaped object in the sky | our experience on earth) = very low

- This is called a _conditional probability_; are _conditioning_ the probabiltiy of one event occurring on something else.

## UFOs

- Probability of hypothesis, given experience:
  - $P(H_1 \mid X)$ = very, very low.

- But what if $H_2$ = a film is being made outside your window?
  - $P(H_1 \mid X)$ = very low.

(example taken from Kurt, 2019)

## UFOs

Perhaps we have a new hypothesis?

- $P(D_{updated} \mid H_2, X) >> P(D_{updated} \mid H_1, X)$
- The probability of the data, given the second hypothesis, is much greater than the first.


## UFOs

We can express the comparison of these two hypotheses as a ratio:

$\frac{P(D_{updated} \mid H_2, X)}{P(D_{updated} \mid H_1, X)}$

If this is a large number (like 1000), it means that $H_2$ explains the data 1,000 times better than $H_1$

(example taken from Kurt, 2019)


## Converting Odds to Probability

- $P(H) = \frac{O{H}}{1 + O(H)}$

- You give your friend 6:1 odds that Northwestern will beat Purdue in basketball. You'll give your friend $30 if Purdue wins, he will only pay you $5 if Northwestern wins.

- $P(NU Win) = \frac{O(NU Win)}{1 + O(NU Win)} = \frac{6}{7} = .857$

- You are giving NU about an 86% chance of winning.

## Richard III (see Spiegelhalter, p.317)

- Richard III, who Shakespeare characterized as an evil hunchback, was said to have been buried in Greyfriars Priory in Leicester.

## Richard III (see Spiegelhalter, p.317)

We might assume that a skeleton found were the remains of Richard the III if _all_ of the following were true:

- he had really been buried in Greyfriars
- his body had not been dug up and moved or scattered in the intervening 527 years
- the first skeleton found happened to be him. 

## Richard III (see Spiegelhalter, p.317)

- Let's say 50% chance the stories of his burial were true
- Let's say 50% chance that his skeleton is still where he was originally buried in Greyfriars
- Imagine that up to 100 other bodies were also buried in this location.
- 1/2 * 1/2 * 10/100 = 1/400.


## Richard III (see Spiegelhalter, p.318)

## The Posterior

- The probability of a hypothesis given the data is called the _posterior_.

- the posterior is proportional to the likelihood times the prior.

- $P(H \mid D)$ is proportional to $P(D|H) x P(H)$
