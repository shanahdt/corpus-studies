## Types of Studies (continued from last week)

In general, it is helpful to classify studies according to four
criteria:

1.  Does the researcher simply describe and observe? Or does the
    researcher offer an interpretation or *explanation*? (That is,
    does the study offer an explanatory theory?)
2.  Does the researcher make a *prediction*? (That is, does the method
    invite failure?)
3.  Does the researcher *manipulate* the world? (That is, does the
    method allow the researcher to infer causality?) And
4.  Does the researcher count or measure something? (That is, is the
    research qualitative or *quantitative*?)

## A Table



                                   **Explanatory Theory**   **Hypothesis Tested**   **Infer Causality**   **Quantitative**
  ------------------------------- ------------------------ ----------------------- --------------------- ------------------
  **Reconnaisance**                                                                                      
  **Descriptive**                      ***post hoc***                                                    
  **Measurement**                                                                                              **✓**
  **Correlational**                    ***a priori***               **✓**                                      **✓**
  **Exploratory Correlational**        ***post hoc***                                                          **✓**

## Measurement Studies

- The measurement study is a type of exploratory study. 

- It differs from the reconnaissance and descriptive studies insofar as some sort of measurement is involved. 

- It differs from the exploratory correlational study insofar as the researcher doesn't attempt to determine whether there are relationships between any of the measurements.


## Measuring Syncopation

> In order to measure syncopation, we had to make an operational
> definition. In metrically organized music, each moment can be regarded
> as occupying a particular point in the metric hierarchy. The highest
> point (labelled "1") might be defined as coinciding with the
> downbeat. The second highest point ("2") coincides with the third
> beat in 4/4 meter. Other points in the metric hierarchy can be
> similarly labelled as shown in Figure 1. 

See this Huron and Ommen study: ([emp_methods_workshop](syncopation.qmd))


## Correlational Study

- Correlational studies aim to identify linkages or relationships between things. We say two things are correlated when there is some sort of connection or association between them. 

- For example, music with a fast tempo tends to be louder than music with a slow tempo. Although there are exceptions to this, in general, there is a correlation between tempo and dynamic level.

## Correlational  Study

1.  Correlational studies may or may not be hypothesis-driven. When
    there is no *a priori* hypothesis, the study is said to be an
    exploratory correlational study.
2.  Correlational studies always involve at least two sets of
    measurements.
3.  A common type of correlational study is the survey or
    questionnaire.

## Experimental Study

- What distinguishes an experiment from all other kinds of studies is that the experimenter *manipulates* the world. Rather than being just a passive observer, the experimenter intentionally makes some change and then observes the effect of the change.

## Experimental Study

- The variable manipulated by the experimenter is called the *independent variable* (or independent measure). The variable observed by the experimenter is called the *dependent variable* (or dependent measure).


## Exploratory Experiment

- An *Exploratory Experiment* involves manipulation and measurement, but the manipulation is not motivated by some prior theory, hypothesis or conjecture. 

    - For example, a researcher might play traditional Japanese and Andean pop music to naive Western listeners while making a series of measurements, such as heart-rate, respiration, body temperature, and observable behavior, etc. The researcher may have no idea what to expect. That is, no prediction was made. 

## Meta-Study

- A meta-study is a "study of studies." 

    - It is typically done when a large number of studies have been carried out related to some problem.

## Modeling Study

-  Theories can often be implemented as models. An example of a *physical model* is a large model of San Francisco Bay built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (see photo).

## Pilot Study

- A pilot study is carried out simply as a way of testing the research procedure. Pilot studies usually involve relatively small numbers of participants or small sample sizes.

## Mixed Methods

> The research might begin by reporting a descriptive
> study. The results from the descripive study may inspire the authors
> to formulate a theory, from which a hypothesis is generated. The
> article might then go on to report a correlational study or an
> experiment whose purpose is to explicitly test the hypothesis.

## Natural Experiments

- A special kind of experiment is the so-called *natural experiment.* A natural experiment relies on a manipulation of the real world that occurs without the intervention of the researcher.

    - In March of 2020, climate scientists studied the lessening of air pollution during lockdown. 

    - There *is* a manipulation being made of sorts and a control condition, but it really is only possible at a grand scale because of an uncontrollable global event.

## Clever Hans

> [From Wikipedia:] "Hans was a horse owned by Wilhelm von Osten,
> who was a mathematics teacher, an amateur horse trainer,
> phrenologist, and something of a mystic. Hans was said to have been
> taught to add, subtract, multiply, divide, work with fractions, tell
> time, keep track of the calendar, differentiate musical tones, and
> read, spell, and understand German. Von Osten would ask Hans, "If
> the eighth day of the month comes on a Tuesday, what is the date of
> the following Friday?" Hans would answer by tapping his hoof.
> Questions could be asked both orally, and in written form. Von Osten
> exhibited Hans throughout Germany, and never charged admission."


## Clever Hans 

**Clever Hans Effect:** An experimenter may inadvertently provide
non-verbal (or verbal) cues as to what they hope will happen. People
can be even more tuned-in than a horse in reading body language.

## Demand Characteristics

- Demand Characteristics: when an experiment becomes invalid because of what participants *believe* is the purpose of the experiment, right or wrong
