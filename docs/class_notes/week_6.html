<p>PCAs are often used for reducing dimensions when we have lots of variables but a model might be better suited from combining those variables. PCAs have also been used a fair bit to explore questions of authorship. Here we have a question of authorship using symbolic data taken from scores. We are trying to explore the music of Josquin.</p>
<p>Here we load the data in:</p>

<p>It’s worth taking some time to explore what each of these components actually means and how they’re weighted. PCA is weighting instances of parallel motion and similar motion pretty heavily, but negatively weighting pitch entropy and oblique motion. PC2 seems to be looking at nPVI and 9-8 suspensions.</p>

<p>So what does this all mean? Let’s define some terms.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accuracy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>the accuracy rate. Just how many things it got right.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>95% CI:</strong>
<ul>
<li>the confidence interval of the accuracy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>No information rate:</strong>
<ul>
<li>given no more information other than the overall distribution, how likely are you to be correct if you just pick the “majority class.”</li>
<li>if you have an accuracy rate of 80%, but the majority class is 80%, then your model isn’t terribly useful.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>P-Value:</strong>
<ul>
<li>likelihood of chance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Kappa:</strong>
<ul>
<li>measures the agreement between two raters and ratings. Here it’s looking at the difference between observed accuracy and random chance given the distribution in the dataset.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>McNemar’s Test P-Value:</strong>
<ul>
<li>this is looking at the two distributions (from a 2x2 table), and determines if they are significantly different,</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sensitivity:</strong>
<ul>
<li>given that a result is actually a thing, what is the probability that our model will predict that event’s results?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Specificity:</strong>
<ul>

<p>Before running a clustering, PCA, or a classifier such as a k-nearest neighbor, it’s probably good to standardize your data. This means that the data is consistent, and prevents wide ranges from dominating the results. Here we’ve scaled all of our data with the z-score of the data according with the rest of the data for that category.</p>
<p>I’ve also (temporarily) split the data from the artist, and then brought it all back together with cbind.</p>

<p>It looks like the accuracy is about 76%, but pay attention to the <em>sensitivity</em> and the <em>specificity</em> values.</p>
<p>Recall that sensitivity is a measurement of how well the model can detect a “positive” instance, and specificity measures how well the model is finding true negatives.</p>
<p>Sensitivity can be defined as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Sensitivity = (True Positive)/(True Positive + False Negative)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and specificity can be defined as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Specificity = (True Negative)/(True Negative + False Positive)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So this model is quite good at finding the negative class (here defined as McCartney), but not great at finding the positive class (Lennon).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>What I like about this is that we can take something about authorship that we know, and then use it to explore authorship of things that are a little more ambiguous. It can also teach us a fair bit about the specific models. Why do we think some performed so much better than others?</p>
