<hr>
<p>Earlier, we distinguished seven types of empirical studies: (1) reconnaissance study, (2) descriptive study, (3) measurement study, (4) correlational study, (5) experimental study, (6) meta-study, and (7) modeling study. Within each of these categories there are different ways of conducting the research. These methods are commonly referred to as <em>research designs</em> or <em>research paradigms</em>. There are dozens of research designs and new ones are constantly being invented. It can be useful to familiarize ourselves with some of the more common designs or paradigms.</p>
<p>Many experimental paradigms are not mutually exclusive. For example, a <em>within-subjects design</em> is often contrasted with a <em>between-subjects design</em>—(see below). Although they seem to be mutually exclusive, there are studies that make use of both within- and between-subjects aspects. These are often referred to as “mixed” designs.</p>
<p><strong>1. Reconnaissance Study</strong></p>
<p>In 2011, Swedish musicologist Alf Gabrielsson published a wonderful book entitled <em>Strong Experiences with Music</em>. The research for this book was carried out by placing advertisements in newspapers across Sweden (most of the work was done before the Internet was popular). Gabrielsson simply invited ordinary Swedes to write to him conveying their most memorable and moving experiences with music. The volume consists primarily of (translated) reports and anecdotes. Although the book is organized according to certain themes, the book is really a collection of reports with some (modest) interpretation. Gabrielsson’s book can be regarded as the endpoint for a Reconnaissance study. Notice that Gabrielsson didn’t travel anywhere: instead of doing “field work,” in effect, he asked people to send him “specimens” of strong musical experiences.</p>
<p><strong>2. Developmental Study</strong></p>
<p>A developmental study is any study that attempts to determine how something (or someone) changes over time. In music, developmental studies are used extensively to chronicle how people change with musical training. For example, a developmental study might examine the effect of some training regime (such as Suzuki method) on children’s musicality. There are two classic methods for studying development. One approach is the “cross-sectional design.” In a cross-sectional design, the research compares people at different points in their development. For example, a researcher might compare</p>
<p>Most developmental studies focus on education or child development. Researchers might simply determine at what age a child is able to synchronize to a beat. Developmental studies are also used to compare different educational curricula. For example, we might choose to compare two commercial music theory textbooks. -pre-test/post-test whether one music theory textbook Developmental studies are</p>
<p>[THIS IS NOT A DEVELOPMENTAL STUDY] Although most developmental studies focus on education, developmental studies can apply to any aspect of change over time, and the changes might relate to objects (like musical instruments) rather than people. For example, an ethnomusicologist may make use of historical documents to trace musical changes in some culture. In a study by Horn and Huron (2015) we examined simple musical changes between 1750 and 1900. For example, around 1750, only 17 percent of music was written in the minor mode. By 1900, the proportion of music in the minor mode had doubled to 34 percent.</p>
<p><strong>3. Cross-sectional Study</strong></p>
<p>A study that recruits participants (or data) for different ages (or periods) in order to determine how some behavior changes over time. In developmental research, a researcher might compare children at ages 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 in order to trace how some skill develops. In historical research, a researcher might compare music in successive decades from 1950 to 2010 in order to chronicle how musical styles have changed.</p>
<p>An example of a cross-sectional study in developmental research in the work of Denis McAuley (2010). McAuley recruited people of different ages, from young children to elderly adults. He simply asked them to (spontaneously) tap their fingers. His research shows that the rate of spontaneous tapping decreases considerably with increasing age. Old people spontaneously tap at a much slower tempo than adolescents who tap slower than young children.</p>
<p>Cross-sectional studies can be confounded by so-called <em>cohort bias</em>. Suppose for example, a researcher wanted to study how musical tastes change with increasing age. Recruiting people of different ages, the results might appear as follows: People in their 80s prefer big band music. People in their 70s prefer smooth jazz and crooners like Frank Sinatra. People in their 60s prefer early rock and roll. People in their 50s prefer funk and disco. People in their 40s prefer heavy metal and punk. People in their 30s prefer rap. Etc. The researcher then concludes that as a person ages, their tastes evolve from rap, through punk, and disco, to early rock, and finally to big band music. Of course, the problem is that each generation grew up with different popular musics. It is not that people’s tastes change dramatically as they got older. This “generational effect” is known as <em>cohort bias.</em> If we see a difference between 6 year olds and 10 year olds, we can’t be sure that this is truly due to aging, or whether it is due to growing up at different times.</p>
<p><strong>4. Longitudinal Study</strong></p>
<p>The longitudinal study is a type of developmental study. Unlike the cross-sectional study, this type of study follows individual changes over time. The most famous longitudinal study is the <em>Framingham Heart Study</em> named after the small town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The study began in 1948 with 5,209 adult participants. (The study continues to this day, and is now following the third generation of Framingham residents.) The study focuses on cardiovascular disease. Regular information is collected on lifestyle, environmental factors, and inheritance. Much has been learned from this study regarding factors that contribute to heart disease and related health problems.</p>
<p>In music, perhaps the best example of a longitudinal study in music is a famous 1999 study carried out by Eugenia Costa-Giomi. For years, research has shown that children who take music lessons perform better on a range on non-musical tasks. For example, children who study music exhibit better cognitive skills, exhibit better verbal and mathematical abilities, show better motor proficiency, higher self-esteem, and score higher in academic achievement compared with children who don’t take music lessons. These results are evident even when the children have been carefully matched for socio-economic status.</p>
<p>The problem with these studies is that they are all correlational. (Remember, “no causation without manipulation.”) Suppose we have two children: one who expresses interest in music lessons and another who doesn’t. Perhaps the first child is simply more outgoing, or has greater curiosity, or the second child suffers from lethargy, or whose parents are less enthusiastic. In short, taking music lessons per se may not be the cause of the improvement, but a symptom of better starting aptitudes and dispositions.</p>
<p>A proper experiment would assemble a group of children, and randomly assign them to either music lessons, or no music lessons. The study would use a pre-test to establish intelligence, self-esteem, and other measures. After several years, we would then conduct a post-test to see if those children who had been randomly assigned to receive music lessons improved more than those children who had been randomly assigned not to receive music lessons.</p>
<p>Costa-Giomi’s study did just that. Six-three fourth-grade children were randomly assigned to receive free weekly personal piano lessons (for three years!). Brand new pianos were delivered to each of their homes at no cost. Fifty-four children were randomly assigned not to receive lessons. At the beginning of the study, there were no differences between the two groups of children in terms of cognitive abilities, musical abilities, motor proficiency, self-esteem, academic achievement, or interest in studying music. Each year, these tests were repeated in order to observe possible changes in both groups. After three years of instruction, the students receiving piano lessons were no different than the control students in any of the measures of developmental, quantitative, or verbal cognitive abilities. Costa-Giomi’s study suggests that people who choose to take music lessons and who persevere at those lessons already have a disposition to high achievement. The research is not consistent with the hypothesis that the music lessons themselves contribute to higher achievement.</p>
<p>Notice that cross-sectional studies are easier to perform than true longitudinal studies. But longitudinal studies are the only kinds of developmental studies that control for possible cohort bias.</p>
<p>Lest you find this story utterly depressing, it is appropriate to point out the Glenn Schellenberg did a follow-up study in 2004 with a very large sample and did see measurable cognitive improvements in the music treatment group compared with the control group, although the effect size was small.</p>
<p><strong>5. Preferential Looking Paradigm</strong></p>
<p>Where do musical tastes come from? How do we learn how to repeat a heard melody? There are many questions about how we interact with music that have their origin in our earliest encounters with music. We can’t really answer these questions without some understanding the formation of skills or tendencies of infants. But, how does one learn how an infant perceives music? Certainly we can’t ask them questions.</p>
<p>However, there are ways of finding out how infants perceive musical stimuli. Reliably, humans of any age will orient towards sounds that might indicate a threat. If I suddenly clap, it’ll likely startle most listeners, and the instinctual reaction will be to turn towards the sound. Even one full month before birth, fetuses exhibit both the startle reflex and the orienting response. However, if I keep clapping at regular intervals, eventually listeners will habituate to the sound and they’ll stop attending to it.</p>
<p>This orienting response is really helpful in studying infant perception. In addition to being startled by a sound, infants will reliably orient toward sounds that are new or sounds that they prefer. It’s common that babies habituate to sounds fairly quickly and look away, but if there’s a change to the sound, they tend to look back. The more significant the change, the more likely infants will re-orient themselves to the sound.</p>
<p>Jessica Philips-Silver and Laurel Trainor have used orienting responses to try to understand how we come to feel meter in a series of brilliant studies. Specifically, they were curious about why we tend to nod our heads to the music’s pulse. Is there something about the head moving to the beat that reinforces our sense of meter or that is rewarding in some way?</p>
<p>They concocted a rhythm that could easily be heard in either 3/4 (with three pulses per pattern) or 6/8 (with two pulses per pattern), and played it using a computer that avoided accenting any of the rhythms. The condition was whether each 7-month old baby was bounced by the mother twice or three times per pattern.</p>
<p>In the test phase, they situated babies between two speakers. When a baby looked at a speaker, it would play sound. One of the speakers played the rhythm with three accents per pattern (3/4), and the other played the rhythm with two accents per patter (6/8). They found that infants preferred listening to the speaker that matched the pulse they were bounced with, consistent with the notion that moving our heads up and down influences our perception of meter even at an early age before too much enculturation.</p>
<p><strong>6. Correlational Design</strong></p>
<p>Two economists, Claudia Goldin and Cecilia Rouse (2000) conducted a study by gathering orchestral audition records and roster information from eight major U.S. orchestras, spanning the years 1940 to 1995. Their dataset included complete audition record (who auditioned, who was hired) and a complete roster of current ensemble performers (providing a base male-female ratio).</p>
<p>Is there prejudice against female orchestra musicians? A major change in hiring practices has involved “blind” auditions in which the performer plays behind a screen. The Boston Symphony Orchestra adoped screens in auditions in 1952, and other orchestras made the switch to blind auditions in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s.</p>
<p><img src="Images/femalePlayers.png" class="img-fluid" width="500"></p>
<p>In general, whether using blind or non-blind auditions, the proportion of female musicians has increased, reflecting a general increase of female employment in various professional roles. The key question is how much of this increase can be attributed to the use of screens in auditions? The different dates of adoption by different orchestras allows us to assess the “before” and “after” effects of the screens. We need to know the proportion of females who auditioned for each opening, the proportion of females hired, and whether or not a screen was employed. In their study, Goldin and Rouse found that the switch to blind auditions acounts for 30% of the increase in the proportion of female musicians hired. Two conclusions follow: first, the use of screens is consistent with the notion that between 1940 and 1995 there existed a broad prejudice broad prejudice second, much or most of the increase in employment of female musicians was not related to the presence or absence of a screen. “The switch to”blind” auditions can explain, using the roster sample, between 30% and 55% of the increase in the proportion female among new hires and from 25% to 46% of the increase in the percentage of orhcestra musicians who are female.”</p>
<p><strong>7. Life-sample Studies</strong></p>
<p>(Formerly known as <strong>Pager Studies</strong>). How often do people have tunes going through there head? Is there a tune going through your head right now? Often, researchers want to know what is going on in people’s lives, and how frequently particular behaviors occur. Early studies made us of electronic pagers that could be activated at random moments during the day. Participants in the experiment would then record whatever information is being sought by the researcher. Usually that involves completing a survey. Pagers are still in use, but today it is more common to send text messages to mobile phones. For example, Adrian North, David Hargreaves and Jon Hargreaves (2004) recruited 346 volunteers spanning a range of ages: each person was sent one text message per day for 14 days. The texts were scheduled so that they had equal representation between 8 am to 11 pm. On receiving the text message, participants were required to complete a questionnaire about any music they could hear. Life-sample studies have been used to address such questions as how often people listen to music, and what time of day musicians tend to practice. In the North, et al.&nbsp;study, their participants heard music just under 40% of the time. The greatest amount of music listening occurred between 10-11 pm, and music was liked more when it was heard with no other people present.</p>
<p><strong>8. Discrimination Paradigm</strong></p>
<p>Can you tell the difference between an oboe and an English horn? When does a pitch become out-of-tune? Is there a difference between <em>rock-n-roll</em> and <em>rock</em>? Discrimination tasks are often aimed at trying to discover how it is that we identify things and what factors contribute to our categorizing.</p>
<p>A striking example of a discrimination task is evident in in an extraordinary experiment carried out by Michael Hall and Richard Pastore. In the first part of their experiment, Hall and Pastore played pure-tone Es and E-flats and measured the intensity threshold below which each musician listener was unable to detect the presence of these tones. In the second part of the experiment, they repeatedly played a C-G dyad using a piano timbre. They added either a pure-tone E or E-flat, and asked their listeners to identify whether the resulting chord was major or minor. That is, the task was a discrimination task: major versus minor triads. During the experiment, Hall and Pastore manipulated the intensity of the E or E-flat tones making them progressively quieter. Hall and Pastore made a seemingly astounding discovery: the musicians continued to successfully classify the chords as major or minor even when the sound intensity for the E and E-flat pure tones was reduced below audibility. Some musicians were able to correctly report the chord quality even though the E and E-flat tones were as much as 20 decibels below their hearing thresholds. Said another way, the musicians were able to hear whether a chord was major or minor, even though they were completely unable to hear the crucial third of the chord.</p>
<p>Explaining this result is rather complicated (see Huron, 2016; p.166). However, the important lesson from this experiment is that musicians can perceive chords as basic auditory objects without having to hear the constituent tones.</p>
<p><strong>9. Counterbalanced Design</strong></p>
<p>A counterbalanced design is any design in which the manipulations are conducted in a symmetrical way. Consider the following experiment by percussionist Michael Schutz. Among percussionists there has been a long-standing debate about the effects of different strokes. When playing a marimba or other mallet instrument, one can strike the key with a short-sharp gesture (let’s call that staccato), or one might strike the key with a smooth-graceful gesture (let’s call that legato). Does it matter? Acousticians argue that how you strike a key has no effect on the sounded duration of the note. That is, with a mallet instrument, a “staccato” stroke will not produce a sound that is shorter in duration than a “legato” stroke. Some percussionists consequently argue that performers should forget about differentiating staccato and legato strokes. They have no musical effect.</p>
<p>Schutz wasn’t so sure—even though he thinks the acousticians are right. Schutz recorded the sounds produce by mallet instruments using different gestures. The recordings include both audio and video. He played the recordings to listeners who had to judge the duration of the tone produced by each stroke. Using a counterbalanced design, he also edited the videos so that one version included the sound produced by the staccato stroke but matched with the video image of the legato stroke. Similarly, he produed an edited version in which the sound produced by the legato stroke was matched with the video of the staccato stroke. So he produced four different stimuli: staccato(sound)+staccato(video), staccato(sound)+legato(video), legato(sound)+legato(video), and legato(sound)+staccato(video). (This makes the experiment a counterbalanced design.) Listeners judged the durations of sounds in both the audiovisual condition, and also judged the durations of the sounds in the audio-only condition.</p>
<p>In the audio only condition, the staccato and legato sounds were judged by listeners to have the same durations. That is, the results confirmed what acousticians claim. However, in the video condition, Schutz found a dramatic visual effect. Listeners judged the sounds matched with the staccato video to always sound shorter than the sounds matched with the legato video. The actual acoustical sound didn’t matter. The visual manner in which the percussionist played actually caused listeners to perceive the tone as longer or shorter. Schutz’s research suggests that percussionists can indeed make a musical passage sound more staccato or legato by the type of stroke they use. But the perceptual effect is due to sight, not sound (Schutz &amp; Lipscomb, 2007; Schutz, 2008).</p>
<p><strong>10. Reaction-time Experiment</strong></p>
<p>Bret Aarden’s work - perhaps emphasize how cadences and cadential approaches are more predictable (faster reaction times). e.g. reaction time experiments (do’s and don’ts) -importance of motivating participants (useful to set up as a game)</p>
<p><strong>11. Implicit Association Test (IAT)</strong></p>
<p>The implicit association test (IAT) is a popular method for investigating pre-conscious associations between different kinds of stimuli. The method has been especially successful in establishing unconscious bias and uncovering stereotypes. For example, although a person may consciously think they hold no bias against blacks, the method can be used to show that that person is nevertheless suspicious of black people.</p>
<p>The method involves speeded judgments of different stimuli. For example, the participant might see photographs of The method makes use of reaction time—so it might be considered a type of reaction-time study.</p>
<p>A common implicit association task asks people to identify as quickly as possible whether visually-presented words are positively or negatively valenced. Classifying the words is trivial since the valence is obvious — as in the words <em>joy, fun, party, kiss, hatred, misery, victim,</em> and <em>disgust</em>. Participants carry out the task as quickly as possible while their reaction time is measured. Immediately prior to presenting the word a sound is heard. For example, in one study by Frank Ragozzine (2011), participants heard either a major triad or a minor triad. The results for Ragozzine’s experiment are shown below:</p>
<p><img src="Images/IATmodality1.png" class="img-fluid" width="500"> <img src="Images/IATmodality2.png" class="img-fluid" width="500"></p>
<p>from Frank Ragozzine (2011)</p>
<p>The left graph displays the error rate. For example it shows that roughly 2 percent of judgments of negative words were incorrectly classified when the word was heard in conjunction with a major chord. The error rate is roughly half when the negative word is accompanied by a minor chord. Similarly, notice that positive words produce few errors when accompanied by a major chord, but many more errors when a positive word is linked with a minor chord.</p>
<p>The right graph displays the reaction times. Once again, the same pattern holds. Participants are slow to respond when a positive word is accompanied by a minor chord, or a negative word is accompanied by a major chord. Conversely, the fastest responses occur when positive words are linked to major, and negative words are linked to minor.</p>
<p>Notice that all of the average reaction times are less than a second. This means that there isn’t enough time for a person to “think” about any relationship between what they hear and the word they see. That is, the judgment is not made consciously or explicitly. The relationship is more automatic or implicit. In short, at least for Western-enculturated listeners, there is a natural association between major+positive and minor+negative.</p>
<p>A similar IAT experiment was conducted by Bernhard Sollberger, Rolf Reber, and Doris Eckstein (2003). Instead of major or minor chords, they played either consonant (D4, A4, D5) or dissonant (D4, A#4, D5) sonorities. Their results are shown below. Once again we see the same pattern of errors and reaction times suggesting that consonance is associated with something positive and dissonance is associated with something negative.</p>
<p><img src="Images/IATdisson1.png" class="img-fluid" width="500"> <img src="Images/IATdisson2.png" class="img-fluid" width="500"></p>
<p>Other IAT studies by Nikolaus Steinbeis and Stefan Koelsch (2011) have shown an association between major/happy and minor/sad.</p>
<p><strong>12. Probe-Tone Study</strong></p>
<p>The probe-tone method involves playing some kind of musical context, followed by a single tone (or chord). The listener is asked to judge something about that probe tone or chord. For example, the listener might be asked to judge how well the probe tone fits with the preceding musical context. Probe tone studies are commonly used to explore listener expectations—whether the probe tone conforms to what they think might happen next.</p>
<p>An example of a probe tone study is an experiment conducted by theorist Mark Yeary. Yeary played a three-note chord followed by a single probe tone. Listeners simply indicated whether the probe tone matched the pitch of the middle tone in the target chord. The main manipulation was the context preceding the three-note chord. One context consisted of a four-note melody that would have been expected to stream with the highest note of the target chord. A contrasting context consisted of four three-note chords (none of which contained the final probe tone). Yeary found that listeners abilities to correctly discriminate the presence of the probe tone in the target chord were significantly reduced when the preceding context consisted of chords only—suggesting that a “chordal context” encourages listeners to hear the target chord holistically as a chord-object rather than as three individual tones.</p>
<p><strong>13. Two-Alternative Forced Choice (2AFC) experiment</strong></p>
<p>The 2AFC experiment is one of the most commonly used designs in perceptual research. Here, the participant is presented with two stimuli and asked to make some sort of choice. Which of these two sounds is more dissonant? Which of these two sounds is louder? Which of these two sounds do you prefer? And so on. As you might expect, sometimes participants are given more than two choices. For example, if the participant is given three alternatives, the paradigm is (naturally) referred to as a three-alternative forced choice, abbreviated 3AFC.</p>
<p>An example of a forced-choice experiment is a study by Ollen and Huron (2004). We were interested in testing the effect of musical repetition on preferences for certain musical forms. Specifically, we were interested whether listeners prefer “early repetition”—where repeated material tends to happen early in the form rather than later in the form. For example, do listeners prefer a repetition pattern like A A B A over the reverse A B A A? For this experiment, we composed over 100 brief atonal piano textures ranging in duration from about half a second to 12 seconds. Using these passages, we constructed short “modernist-sounding” compositions by randomly assembling a pallet of two or three segments. Each composition made use of a repetition pattern and was paired with another composition using the reverse pattern. So, for example, a listener might hear a short composition structured as A A A B A B A, and it’s reverse A B A B A A A. Listeners heard these pairs and were asked to choose which “composition” they preferred. We found that listeners preferred the repetition patterns in which most of the repetition occurred early in the composition.</p>
<p><strong>14. Betting Paradigm</strong></p>
<p>Together with Paul von Hippel and ethnomusicologist David Harnish, we endeavored to trace the musical expectations of Indonesian and American musicians by having them bet on successive notes of an unfamiliar Javanese melody played on a Peng Ugal instrument. The experiment works as follows. Bets are placed on the keys of a mock-up of an instrument Bets need not all be placed on a single outcome. Instead, participants are free to distribute the poker chips across several possible continuations—varying the number of chips wagered according to the degree of certainty or uncertainty. Bets placed on the correct pitch are rewarded tenfold. Bets placed on incorrect pitches are lost. Participants are instructed to try to maximize their winnings.</p>
<p>Wagers are made following each note in the melody. The experiment begins with the participant hearing the first note of the melody while the pitch is indicated on a computer monitor. The participant is then invited to bet on what she or he thinks will be the second note. Once bets are placed, the actual second note is revealed, the winnings tabulated, and a sound recording of the melody is played, stopping before the third note. The participant is then invited to bet on what she or he thinks will be the third note. This process is repeated until a complete melody has been revealed.</p>
<p>In our experiment both American and Balinese musicians were tested on a traditional Balinese melody (Huron, 2006). Throughout the experiment, participants could see the notation up to the current point in the melody, and could try out different continuations using a digital keyboard sampler that emulated the sound of the <em>peng ugal.</em> The betting context helped participants consider other possibilities apart from the first one that comes to mind.</p>
<p>The principal benefit of the betting paradigm is that it allows the experimenter to calculate the subjective probabilities for different continuations. Assuming that the participant is behaving rationally, bets should be placed in proportion to the subjective likelihood of subsequent events. For example, if a participant thinks that a certain pitch is twice as likely as another pitch, then the participant ought to place twice as large a bet on the more probable pitch.</p>
<p>There are also several problems with the betting paradigm. For one thing, the procedure is tedious. On average, we have found that it takes roughly three minutes for participants to complete their wagers for each note in the melody. So a thirty-five-note melody thus can take as long as two hours to complete. Fortunately, the majority of our participants report that the task is fun, and that the gambling aspect of the task was highly motivating.</p>
<p><strong>15. Physiological Study</strong></p>
<p>Hajime Fukui (2001) carried out a study where he measured testosterone levels from saliva samples collected from undergraduate-aged participants while they listened to their favorite music. Compared with a control group that listened to no music, the testosterone levels dropped significantly. Moreover, Fukui found no sex-related differences: testosterone levels dropped by a similar proportion in both male and female listeners.</p>
<p><strong>16. Method of Adjustment</strong></p>
<p>In many experiments, an experimenter plays various sounds to listeners and asks them make some kind of judgment. For example, a researcher might play several renditions of the same music in which the tempo has been changed in order to determine what tempo the listener thinks is most appropriate. Notice that there may be a simpler approach to this question. We might provide the participant with an adjustable slider or knob that controls the tempo, and simply ask them to “tune” the tempo to what they think is appropriate. When we give the participant the tools to manipulate the stimulus themselves, the design is said to employ the method of adjustment. There are several obvious advantages when using the method of adjustment. The experimenter often gets more precise data since the experimenter doesn’t need to reduce all of the possible values to a smaller number that can be tested. However, the most important benefit of the method of adjustment is that the experiment can be done much more quickly.</p>
<p>An example of a study that uses the method of adjustment is a study by Caitlyn Trevor (2016). Research has suggests that listeners are strongly influenced by the visual element of performance. Trevor wanted to determine whether the amount of performer movement plays a role: Do people prefer performers who gesticulate and move around a lot? She recorded four performers playing different instruments and simultaneously recorded their movements using motion capture technology. She then used the motion capture data to create stick-figure animations of the performer motion. This allowed her to eliminate the potential confounding effect of clothing, performer attractiveness, sex and other visual factors. She provided participants with a slider that allowed them to dynamically adjust the range of movement — from quite attenuated movement to highly exaggerated movement. Participants could hear the music and watch the stick-figure performers simultaneously. They were simply instructed to adjust the amount of performer movement so that it seemed most musically appropriate. Trevor found that all of the participants adjusted the amount of movement so that the performer motions were slightly exaggerated. That is, listeners prefer performers to move more than they actual move when playing.</p>
<p><img src="Images/stickFigure.png" class="img-fluid" width="500"></p>
<p><strong>17. Factorial Design</strong></p>
<p>Many experiment manipulate two or more factors or variables. For example, a researcher might want to investigate the effect of different treatments on the perception of major and minor chords. For example, what happens when the chords are played loud versus soft, staccato versus legato, and using bright versus dark timbres. In short, there are four factors (chord quality, loudness, articulation, timbre). In this case, each factor has two levels (e.g., major/minor, loud/soft …). An experiment is said to employ a factorial design when all possible values or levels are used in all possible combinations. In this hypothetical experiment with chords, there would have to be a minimum of 16 stimuli: 2 chord qualities X 2 loudness levels X 2 articulations X 2 timbres. A full factorial design is also sometimes called a fully crossed design.</p>
<p><strong>18. Two-Experiment Ploy</strong></p>
<p>[used for music and depressive realism experiment]</p>
<p><strong>19. Telephone paradigm</strong></p>
<p>Albrecht and Shanahan carried out an experiment that was inspired by John Spitzer’s (1994) JAMS article “Oh! Susanna: Oral transmission and tune transformation.” Spitzer traces variants of the song, asembles a stemma showing th efiliation of sources, and then offers four observations about oral transmission: transmission: (1) a tendency to alter rhythms in order to clarify the beat; (2) a tendency to pentatonicize the melody; (3) a tendency for a salient harmony to draw the melody to the chord root; and (4) a tendency to eliminate differences between parallel passages.</p>
<p>Shanahan and Albrecht tested #2 using a “telephone game”-like experiment. They selected various folksongs, some that end with ti-doh, and some that end with re-doh. They had sung recordings (without words) of each. They would play the recording three times to a given participant. That participant would then perform the song (making another recording). That recording was played three times to the next participant, who in turn made the next recording, and so on, for four participants. Each participant sang four different songs, in each ordinal role: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th. They then transcribed the target passages. As predicted, they found a statistically significant tendency for ti-doh to be “pentatonicized” to re-doh, but less likely for re-doh to switch to ti-doh.</p>
<p><strong>20. Catch-Recatch Method</strong></p>
<p>This method is commonly used in biology, but it has value in other fields as well. Suppose a fisheries biologist may be interested in estimating the number of fish in some lake. How could you ever determine the population without draining the lake and counting them? What biologists do is to catch a given number of fish (say 100), tag them, and release them back into the lake. After some time (perhaps a month), they return to the lake and catch another 100 fish. This time, they are interested in the number of fish that are tagged. If two of the 100 fish are tagged, then the catch of 100 fish amounts to 2 percent of the total catchable fish. Consequently, we can estimate the number of (catchable) fish in the lake as 5,000.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, the catch-recatch method has not been used in music. However, it could certainly be used to try to estimate various population sizes. Suppose, for example, that you wanted to know how many Metal fans in Dayton (Ohio) regularly attend concerts at a particular venue. Audience members are not eager to have their names recorded. You might know that a concert is attended by 1,200 people and that the parking lot for the venue has 400 cars—suggesting that the average car transports three fans. The researcher might randomly wander through the parking lot during a concert and record the license numbers for 100 randomly-selected cars. At a subsequent concert, the researcher again wanders through the parking lot and identifies those cars whose licenses were recorded at the previous concert. If you have 20 repeat cars, then the catch-recatch ratio is 5:1. If the concert attendance is again 1,200 people, it suggests that the entire fan base for Metal fans in Dayton is roughly 6,000 people.</p>
<p><strong>21. Meta-Analysis Study</strong></p>
<p>Very few meta-analysis studies have been accaried out on musical topics. One notable study was conducted by Friedrich Platz and Reinhard Kopiez (2012). They examined 33 studies examining the influence of the visual component on music perception. To what extent does vision influence music appreciation. On might suppose, for example, that musical judgments might be influenced by such factors as the attractiveness of the performer, the manner of dress, how the performer moves, the pleasantness of the environment, and other visual aspects.</p>
<p>The purpose of a meta-analysis is to amalgamate all of the pertinent research and (1) attempt to resolve whether there is a real effect, and (2) if so, to estimate the size (or importance) of the effect. A meta-analysis begins by identifying all of the pertinent studies. Because of positive results bias, meta-analysis researchers endeavor to also uncover so-called “grey” literature—pertinent research reports that were never published. If one relies only on published journal articles, then the estimate of effect size is likely to be over-estimated.</p>
<p>Having identified both published and grey literature, the next stage is to specify eligibility criteria for inclusion. Not all studies are done well. Studies may fail to include appropriate control conditions. One may want to include only true experiments and exclude correlational studies, etc. In the case of the work by Platz and Kopiez (2012), just 15 studies passed their pre-specified eligibility criteria. These 15 studies can be treated as one big experiment (involving some 1,298 participants).</p>
<p>As you might expect, Platz and Kopiez found that the aggregate research points to a significant influence of visual aspects on musical experience. There are different ways of quantifying effect size, but a common measure is <em>Cohen’s d</em>. In the case of the visual aspect of performance, Platz and Kopiez calculated a Cohen’s d of 0.51. This is considered a “medium” effect size. Cohen would describe this effect size as something that would be apparent to a careful observer. The effect size is comparable to the perceived different in intelligence between two people whose IQs differ by 8 IQ points.</p>
