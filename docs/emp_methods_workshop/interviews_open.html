<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-exploratory-open-interview">The Exploratory Open Interview</h3>
<hr>
<p>The open interview is one of the very best exploratory research methods. Open interviews are commonly used by social workers, detectives, clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, sociologists, historians, investigative journalists, as well as anthropologists and ethnomusicologists. The open interview is also known by other names, including <em>qualitative interview, unstructured interview, free interview, narrative interview, depth interview</em> and <em>nondirective interview</em>.</p>
<p>Different disciplines have different names for the person being interviewed. A detective interviews <em>witnesses</em> and <em>suspects.</em> Social workers interview <em>clients.</em> Clinical psychologists interview <em>patients.</em> Sociologists interview <em>subjects, participants</em> or <em>respondents.</em> Anthropologists and ethnomusicologists interview <em>informants, experts</em> or <em>research collaborators.</em> In our discussion, we’ll refer to people being interviewed as either <em>interviewees</em> or <em>respondents.</em></p>
<p>Open interviews are valuable for at least three reasons. First, open interviews invite observations that are unanticipated by the researcher. Interviewees provide access to first-person “facts” that are otherwise inaccessible. Interviews can draw attention to unique experiences that are beyond the personal experience of the researcher. The interview can draw attention to novel phenomena, and different forms of human experience.</p>
<p>Second, interviews can introduce the researcher to different ways of thinking about a question or phenomenon. Interviewees are apt to offer different perspectives or unique interpretations. The ideas offerred by interviewees inevitably expand the horizons of the researcher. Interviews often provide inspiring new conjectures and theories that stimulate the researcher’s imagination. As Robert Weiss has noted, “those who do qualitative interview studies invariably wind up knowing a lot about the topic of their study” (Weiss, 1995).</p>
<p>Third, interviews can provide vivid first-person anecdotes. Charities have long recognized the value of personalizing tragic situations. One might make a charity appeal by distributing statistics, such as evidence that 2.2 million people in a particular region of the world are starving. However, charity appeals are much more effective if one tells the story of a single individual: Maria, an 8-year-old child, who, with her mother, is starving in a modest hut. Although the starvation of millions of people is clearly a more serious problem than the starvation of one or two people, the concrete personalized story is far more compelling to human minds.</p>
<p>A similar phenomenon occurs in research. People often find research results dry and uninteresting. Researchers can make the results of research much more compelling to readers by illustrating various findings through personal anecdotes — the sorts of anecdotes that arise from personal interviews rather than through formal experiments or through impersonal questionnaires. Interviews give the researcher access to potentially evocative narratives — stories that can illustrate a phenomena in concrete, human terms. Lifeless theoretical accounts can be brought alive through the judicious relaying of narrative examples.</p>
<p>By way of summary, open interviews can lead to (i) new facts, (ii) new theories, and (iii) vivid illustrations. Open interviews give us access to the experiences of others. Interviews offer new insights.</p>
<p>“Quantitative studies pay a price for their standardized precision. Because they ask the same questions in the same order of every respondent, they do not obtain full reports. Instead, the information they obtain from any one person is fragmentary, made up of bits and pieces of attitudes and observations and appraisals.” [l. 142]</p>
<p>Interviews also suffer from a number of problems. The information collected is anecdotal, often impressionistic, and conveyed in a social situation in which the respondent is strongly motivated to be viewed with sympathy or admiration. The “presentation of self” typically looms larger in inter-personal situations (such as interviews) compared with the more impersonal or anonymous questionnaire or experiment. We will address the advantages and disadvantages of interviews in more detail at the end of our discussion.</p>
<section id="recruiting-respondents" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="recruiting-respondents">Recruiting Respondents</h4>
<p>Because interviews are labor-intensive, sample sizes are commonly small. It is common, therefore, for researchers to abandon the goal of recruiting a representative sample. Instead, it is common to recruit people who have special knowledge or extensive experience related to some phenomenon. Highly experienced or knowledgeable respondents are commonly referred to as <em>informants, witnesses, experts</em> or <em>research collaborators</em>. Alternatively, the researcher might aim to recruit a heterogeneous group of participants — people who are apt to represent a range of contrasting experiences or perspectives. As an exploratory research method, the main aim of open interviewing is to collect new ideas. Consequently, a representative sample may be less valuable than a heterogeneous sample.</p>
<p>By way of example, a study examining “the concert experience” might focus on interviewing audience members attending classical and popular concerts. However, depending on the aims of the study, a researcher might wish to expand the list of interviewees to including concert promoters, artist managers, publicists, house managers, ticket sellers, scalpers, conductors, musicians, and ushers. Once again, the aim of the sample is not to be representative of average or typical experience, but to be representative of the <em>range</em> or <em>variability</em> of experience.</p>
<p>In ethnographic work, it is common for the researcher to seek out an expert, sometimes called a “key informant.” This is someone with an unusually high level of expertise or advanced knowledge related to the researcher’s subject of interest. Commonly, this is a master musician or master teacher in some musical tradition. Once again, it is hoped that what is lost in representativeness is made up for by the wealth of nuanced detail and the opportunities to glimpse unanticipated experiences.</p>
<p>In some studies, representativeness may be an important goal. Especially if the interview duration is short, it may be possible to assemble a representative sample. From time-to-time there are some well-funded projects that may hire a number of people to carry out the interviewing. A big project might have 30 interviewers. If each interviewer conducts 35 interviews, then the project will be able to draw on information from over a thousand participants. In these projects, it may be possible to assemble a good representative sample.</p>
<p>Even for non-representative samples, a researcher needs to know when they have interviewed a “sufficient” number of people. A general rule of thumb is to stop interviewing new people when the interviews keep covering the same ground with little new information. Robert Weiss offers an unusual criterion for knowing when to stop an interview study:</p>
<p>“A colleague of mine once offered as a general rule that if your report on a group you have studied has truly gotten to the inner dynamics of the group, you can never again visit that group with safety. His idea was that every group has secrets kept from outsiders that the group would be loath to have revealed and still other secrets, even more fundamental, kept from itself, whose surfacing would enrage it.” (Weiss, 1995, l.3701)</p>
<p>In recruiting interviewees, it is important to consider a control group. For example, Ehrensaft (1990) carried out a study of married couples who share parenting. However, Ehrensaft only interviewed couples who share parenting duties without interviewing a comparison group of couples who do not sharing parenting. This makes it nearly impossible to claim that any observation is characteristic of couples who share parenting. Unfortunately, it is common for interview-based researchers to overlook the need for a control group.[1] (See also Weiss, 1995).</p>
<section id="snowball-sampling" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="snowball-sampling">Snowball Sampling</h5>
<p>In the case of recruiting experts, one must often rely on the experts themselves to help you contact and recruit other experts for interviews. This is referred to as <em>snowball sampling.</em> As you might expect, snowball sampling is likely to introduce bias, since there is a strong likelihood of interviewing individuals who are similar. In order to reduce this bias, the researcher should aim to follow lines of referral that lead to people who are unfamiliar with earlier interviewees. For example, suppose that Alice recommends Bill, and you interview them both. Then Bill recommends Carol and Daniel. If Alice knows Daniel but not Carol, then it is preferrable to interview Carol over Daniel. By following this strategy, it is less likely that the researcher will interview only individuals within a single social network. In ethnographic fieldwork, it is common for the researcher to switch to a different village or locale in order to avoid undue emphasis on a single social group. Snowball sampling is a sort of <em>convenience sampling</em> — one that helps in recruiting people with special knowledge or expertise.</p>
<p>Notice that snowball sampling is biased against those who have smaller social networks. Experts who are less sociable are less likely to be known by other experts, and so are less likely to be interviewed.</p>
</section>
<section id="duration" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="duration">Duration</h5>
<p>All research requires a time commitment from those who participate in the study. The duration of the commitment can be quite variable. A questionnaire might take only 5 minutes to complete. An experiment might be finished in 30 minutes. Interviews, by contrast, are frequently the most demanding in terms of time commitment. In most interview research, 90 minutes is a common time period for an interview, and many studies interview participants several times. As a result, interviews often place considerable time demands on participants.</p>
<p>The time committment for an interview can lead to sampling problems. Some people are more cooperative in interviews than others. People who are retired, unemployed, or eager for company are most welcoming to interviewers. People who are busy simply cannot afford the time. Consequently, interview methods tend to be biased toward people who have leisure time. This sampling bias can sometimes be alleviated by choosing places where even busy people have time to spare. Busy people may find themselves with free time when in waiting rooms, in airports, or at hotels in the evening. Some interviewers choose to recruit interviewees at leisure or vacation destinations, like beaches, pools, union halls, church socials, sporting events, yacht clubs, etc.</p>
<p>Potential respondents are often suspicious of anyone requesting an interview. It helps to identify an institutional affiliation, such as a university, or a source of government funding, such as the NSF. Respondents are less likely to participate if the research has a corporate sponsor, and even less likely to participate if there is no apparent institutional affiliation. It helps to provide a business card, with contact information. This will reassure possible interviewees. It helps to have an institutional position (professor), or to cite a principal investigator when recruiting. Recruiting can be done via fliers, email, web announcements, telephone solicitation, personal approach, through local newspaper, media advertising or news stories.</p>
<p>For some topics, the researcher might employ a form of <em>quota sampling,</em> in which a fixed number of interviews are conducted with people representing several roles: e.g.&nbsp;interview 3 composers, 3 conductors, 3 performers, and 3 listeners.</p>

<section id="the-interview-guide" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-interview-guide">The Interview Guide</h4>
<p>Although open interviews may have few predefined questions, they are normally shaped by an <em>Interview Guide</em>. The interview guide is a written document that identifies the goals of the interviews, lists the topics of interest, and provides some suggested questions. The guide may or may not be consulted during the interview itself, although it is common toward the end of the interview for the interviewer to refer to the guide to ensure that all of the pertinent topics have been covered.</p>
<p>As with other research approaches, it is important to test the interview guide by conducting some pilot interviews. It may be impossible to employ an appropriate expert for the pilot interview. Nevertheless, even a non-expert interviewee in a pilot interview may help you recognize ways to refine and improve the interview guide.</p>
<p>When the research topic relates to specific activities, like composing or practising, the guide may follow a diachronic sequence. For example, a guide related to the experience of attending a concert might include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Becoming aware of an up-coming concert.</li>
<li>The decision to attend.</li>
<li>Inviting friends, securing tickets.</li>
<li>Travel to the concert.</li>
<li>Pre-concert activities (e.g., dinner).</li>
<li>In the hall before the start.</li>
<li>The concert experience.</li>
<li>Intermission activities.</li>
<li>Post-concert activities.</li>
<li>The next day: discussion with friends. Monday-morning quarter-backing.</li>
<li>Concert memories, reminiscence, assessment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The guide is intended to help the interviewer organize questions, or to ensure that the respondent has thoroughly addressed the various components in a concert experience.</p>
</section>
<section id="conducting-the-interview" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conducting-the-interview">Conducting the Interview</h4>
<p>Enter the interview prepared. Confirm the interview appointment in advance and show up a little early. Make sure you are fully familiar with the Interview Guide, that you have two copies of the consent form, and that your recording gear is operating propertly.</p>
<p>The first order of business is to establish a positive and professional rapport with the respondent. This begins with an explanation of the aims of the research, a conversation about the formal consent form, and a discussion about the use of the recording. By clearly stating what is expected, respondents are more likely to focus on the research topic and less likely to digress into unrelated topics</p>
<p>Explicitly solicit the interviewee’s <em>partnership</em>. Tell them that you need their help. If there is a significant difference in social status, it is sometimes helpful to adopt the personna of the student or apprentice in a “teacher-student” or “master-apprentice” relationship. By demonstrating your respect and admiration, you may benefit by more detailed narratives and explanations. By contrast, at other times, an interview may produce the best results by being confrontational — pushing an interviewee to go into greater depth, or showing that you are not willing to accept self-serving glosses.</p>
<p>Ask only one question at a time. Give the respondent time to collect his/her thoughts before answering. Show patience. Don’t ask questions simply because you are curious. All of the questions should relate to the research aims. Questions motivated by personal interest immediately mark the interview as unprofessional. Without a professional manner, respondents will begin to doubt that the contents of an interview will remain confidential, and so will resist providing details they might find embarrassing.</p>
<p>In questionnaire research, it is common to ask simple questions near the beginning of the questionnaire; Such questions might include questions of age, musical training, etc. However, in open interviews, it is best to leave these questions to the end of the interview. Beginning an interview with a series of simple factual questions sets the wrong tone. The interviewee is likely to respond to all of the subsequent questions in a perfunctory, factual manner rather than using a conversational or narrative approach.</p>
<p>Discourage respondents from talking in generalities. You want to hear about their specific experiences. Also, discourage respondents from talking about the experiences of others — like friends or partners. This is second-hand information, and the main attraction of interviews is collecting detailed first-hand accounts. Discourage respondents from offering or discussing theories — unless this is part of the aim of the research. Keep the discussion concrete. For example, instead of asking about their concert-going experiences in general, have them recall their most recent concert-going experience. Phrase your questions to help the respondent focus on specific events: “Can you tell me about your most recent …?” “Can you walk me through that event …?”</p>
<p>If the respondent recounts a story that is especially pertinent to the aims of study, don’t hesitate to press for more detail. One of the main advantages of open interviews is the opportunity to obtain such detailed accounts.</p>
<p>Provide “back-channel” feedback with frequent “un-huh,” “yeah,” etc. This demonstrates interest and tells the interviewee that you are not bored. Maintain a respectful and serious demeanor.</p>
<p>In general, let the respondent talk. People are usually more interested in talking about things that are important to them than things that are unimportant. So letting the respondent talk about matters they deem important is apt to be revealing. Moreover, people rarely have the chance to talk at length about their experiences; interviewees will appreciate the opportunity to tell the whole story.</p>
<p>Avoid prompting the respondent with your own words. For example, suppose you ask a question: “Was your argument with the stage manager a clash of personalities?” Don’t be surprised if the respondent then characterizes the argument as resulting from “a clash of personalities.” The words are your’s, not the respondent’s, and so it would be inappropriate to quote the respondent as saying “a clash of personalities.” The final narrative should be in their words, not in your words.</p>
<p>Never judge someone’s behavior. Your purpose is to gather information, even if you find the relayed behavior obnoxious or immoral. If you are recording the interview, sometimes the recording gear may become an impediment: the interviewee may be uncomfortable talking about certain topics or people. At times you may need to turn off the recorder. If so, do your best to retain exactly what is said, and then make notes immediately following the interview. Your personal notes don’t have the same legal status as a recording or a transcript of a recording. So this may allow you to gather information about activities that might be considered illegal or socially unacceptible.</p>
<p>You are not the respondent’s friend or therapist. Don’t offer advice or criticize or judge a person’s actions. Avoid interpreting the respondent’s narrative. If an interviewee becomes emotional, don’t abandon your role as a professional. Be compassionate and sympathetic but maintain a professional image. Offer quiet sympathy, but don’t offer advice, don’t pass judgment, and don’t respond with your own confession. Encourage a sense of collaborative partnership in creating a productive and informative interview.</p>
<p>The cardinal sin of interviewing is to talk about yourself. Resist the temptation to recount your own experiences. You may have your own story that reinforces a story just told by the respondent. In ordinary conversation, it would be appropriate to take turns, and tell you story. However, this is not the purpose of a research interview. Don’t talk about yourself. Don’t tell your own stories. Leave the story-telling to your respondent. The principal role of the interviewer is to listen sympathetically, and to encourage the respondent to speak. Aim to be unobtrusive.</p>
<p>As the interview winds-down, ask the respondent for leads or recommendations about other possible respondents you might recruit for the project. That is, solicit information for <em>snowball sampling.</em> Ask whether the respondent knows other people you have interviewed. This will help you determine the heterogeneity of your sample of interviewees. End the interview by expressing your gratitude. Tell the respondent that you might have some follow-up questions in the future, and ask whether it would be okay to contact them again later.</p>
<p>For informants with considerable knowledge, more than one interview may be appropriate. When a respondent is especially informative, don’t be afraid to ask for more additional meetings. Try to avoid cramming everything into a single interview, unless you know that further interviews are impossible. With more interviews, the respondent is apt to become more comfortable with you. Experienced interviewers know that with more interviews, more is revealled. For example, a person is more likely to admit to illegal activities, or to portray themselves in a less-than-ideal light.</p>

<p>Robert Weiss, an expert on open interviews, talks about “markers.” A marker is “a passing reference made by a respondent to an important event or feeling state.” (Weiss, 1995, l.1469] For example, the respondent might mention the break-up of their band, or make passing reference to an argument with a conductor. In normal conversation, markers are invitations for the conversation partner to pursue the matter further. Markers usually indicate the the respondent is eager to talk about the matter (otherwise it wouldn’t be mentioned).</p>
<p>In ordinary conversation, it is always appropriate to follow up on markers. However, in a research interview, a marker topic may take the interview in a direction that is irrelevant to the aims of the researcher. Here, the interviewer needs to exercise some judgment. If the marker is germane to the research goals, then ask the respondent to expand: “You mentioned the break-up of your band; could you say more about that?” If the subject of the marker is not relevant, then the interviewer should simply let the marker pass. Or, if the interviewer is eager to establish a closer relationship with the respondent, pick-up on the marker, even if the subject is a distraction from the research goals.</p>

<section id="interview-advice" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="interview-advice">Interview Advice</h4>
<p>We might summarize the above advice as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Prepare and use an <em>Interview Guide.</em> Update the guide as you continue doing interviews.</li>
<li>Explain the aims of the research to the respondent.</li>
<li>Only ask one question at a time.</li>
<li>Don’t ask questions out of idle curiosity, or questions that are irrelevant to the research goals. Such questions will make you appear less professional.</li>
<li>Discourage respondents from talking in generalities. Tell the respondent you are interested in specific experiences.</li>
<li>Provide “back-channel” feedback with frequent “un-huh,” “yeah,” etc. This demonstrates interest and encourages the respondent to speak.</li>
<li>Be vigilant for markers that signal topics that are pertinent to the research goals. Don’t pick-up on markers that are irrelevant to the research goals.</li>
<li>Avoid “seeding” the respondent with certain words or phrases. Ensure that the narrative is in <em>their</em> words rather than <em>your</em> words.</li>
<li>Never judge someone’s behavior. Your purpose is to gather information, even if you find the relayed behavior obnoxious or immoral.</li>
<li>Don’t offer advice. You are not the respondent’s therapist or friend. Simply listen, and offer a sympathetic ear.</li>
<li>Don’t talk about yourself. A major attraction for respondents is the personal attention paid by the interviewer. People feel validated when they receive someone’s uninterrupted attention.</li>
<li>Aim to be unobtrusive.</li>
<li>Ask the respondent for leads or recommendations about other possible respondents you might recruit for the project. That is, solicit information for <em>snowball sampling.</em></li>
<li>End the interview by expressing your gratitude, and asking the respondent whether it would be possible to follow-up with further questions in the future.</li>
</ol>

<section id="analyzing-interviews" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analyzing-interviews">Analyzing Interviews</h4>
<p>The aim of analysis depends on the goals of the interviews. For investigative journalists, detectives and historians, the goal will be to uncover the sequence of events, and to draw attention to the ways in which different informants interpret the events differently. For the clinical psychologist or psychiatrist, the aim of interview analysis might be to formulate a diagnosis and to assess the conditions that might lead to a helpful intervention. For sociologists and political scientists, the aim of analysis might be to chronicle the effects of particular policies. For anthropologists and ethnomusicologists, the aim of analysis might be to glimpse the cultural factors that shape thought and behavior.</p>
<p>The analysis of interviews may be highly structured (such as following the DSM procedures for diagnosing mental disorders), or may be highly informal. Just listening to (or reading transcripts of) the interviews may be highly informative without any analysis. For example, a series of vignettes of people describing their experiences of a hurricane may stand on their own, without the need to interpret or analyze them. An interviewer might choose to tell a story simply based on the overall impressions arising from the interviews.</p>
<p>There are few formal methods for analyzing interviews. However, most formal analyses include the following elements:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>transcribe the recordings</li>
<li>proofing the transcripts</li>
<li>breaking up the transcripts into topic-units or vignettes</li>
<li>sorting the comments into topic categories</li>
<li>coding the comments within each topic</li>
<li>collating and summarizing the coded material in each topic</li>
</ol>
<p>We expand on these analysis elements below.</p>
<p>After transcribing and proofing the transcripts, it is common to mark-up the transcript by labelling topics of conversation. For example, a researcher might label a transcript segment “dressing before going to a concert.” Most topic labels will emerge in a straightforward manner from the transcript. However, in light of the goals of the research, certain topics will be regarded as important even before you begin your analysis. Many of these topics will already be evident from the interview guide. For example, a series of interviews related to <em>the concert experience</em> might include becoming aware of an up-coming concert, the decision to attend, inviting friends, securing tickets, travel to the concert, pre-concert activities, etc. Label interview segments according to these topics.</p>
<p>As you label the topics of conversation, new topics will emerge from the interviews themselves. For example, <em>concert memorabilia</em> (T-shirts, buttons, posters, etc.) may emerge as a pertinent topic — even though it was not anticipated in the interview guide. In general, be vigiliant to allow the emergence of new topic from the interviews themselves.</p>
<p>Having labelled the topics, the researcher typically extracts similar topic materials from various interview transcripts and copies them into topical folders. For example, all of the discussions regarding <em>intermission activities</em> may be collated together.</p>
<p>Once the materials are collated, they may be <em>coded</em> according to some criterion or criteria. These criteria may be <em>a priori</em> ideas, or they may emerge from the transcripts themselves. For example, the researcher may become aware that it is common for people to change their concert plans for various reasons. The researcher might then elect to code the material according to the reason for the change. For example, you might code comments as “Decided to pursue an alternative activity because the concert was deemed too expensive.” Or “Decided to purse an alternative activity because transportation to the concert venue would be difficult.” Or “Decided to pursue an alternative activity because of the failure to find a companion.” etc.</p>
<p>In some cases, the coding may be uncontroversial. However, in other cases, the researcher may be “reading between lines” — infering something that is not explicit. In order to enhance coding validity, it may be appropriate to recruit an assistant or collaborator who independently codes the transcripts according to the same criteria. The researcher might then only rely on codings that agree between the two coders.</p>
<p>Analysis of interviews is not guarranteed to lead to any coherent conclusions. Sometimes, the researcher can summarize the interviews by simply relaying various anecdotes, without offering any interpretation. At the other extreme, an obvious over-arching pattern may be evident in the interviews. In this case, the researcher may be able to summarize the interviews by proposing or describing a broad theory. More likely, only some aspects of the interviews will admit a generalized interpretation. Coded data might contribute to the plausibility of certain interpretations. For example, a researcher might conclude (on the basis of coded transcripts) that the most common reason for deciding against attending a concert is the failure to interest a companion.</p>
<p>In dealing with descriptions of events, both detectives and historians will hope to be able to use the interviews to assemble a coherent descriptive narrative. If all of the interviews converge on a coherent story, then the task of weaving together the various perspectives offered by different informants should be straightforward. However, if there are discrepancies between informants, then both the historian and the detective will need to draw attention to the different interpretations of what is nominally the same event.</p>

<section id="advantages-and-disadvantages-of-interviews" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="advantages-and-disadvantages-of-interviews">Advantages and Disadvantages of Interviews</h4>
<p>In general, empirical researchers have tended to <em>underestimate</em> the value of exploratory interviews. Open interviews provide quick access to rich ideas and interpretations of a range of human experiences. Interviews immerse the researcher in a dense world, full of relationships, contexts, nuanced distinctions, competing interpretations, and (sometimes) fascinating anecdotes. It would take many decades for hypothesis-driven research to achieve the sort of complex picture that emerges from open interviewing. Interviews are apt to generate a lot of ideas with relatively little effort.</p>
<p>Interviews are especially valuable when investigating something new. When an anthropologist visits a novel culture, it is important to be open to whatever it is that is distinctive, unique or surprising about that culture. Of course anthropologists have their own agendas. An anthropologist might be interested in child-rearing practices or religious observances. However, a good anthropologist will be alert to other possibilities. For example, the child-rearing or religious practices might be very similar to those found in other cultures, while the medicinal practices or decorative arts might be extraordinary. A researcher doesn’t know what is important until they are exposed to lots of possibilities. There are times when the research agenda should not be set by the researcher in advance. This is the whole purpose of exploratory research. Open interviews provide one of the very best methods for exposing the researcher to unexpected phenomena.</p>
<p>At the same time, qualitative researchers have tended to <em>overestimate</em> the value of open interviews. First, interviewers rarely question the accuracy of the information provided by an interviewee or informant. Although qualitative researchers acknowledge the problems of validity, they rarely (if ever) verify specific claims by examining independent sources. Interviews are only as good as the accuracy of introspection and memory. Validity is not simply an issue of respondents telling the whole truth. Research on eyewitness testimony is sobering. For example, research by Elizabeth Loftus and her colleagues has established the extraordinary fallibility (and suggestibility) of human memory (Loftus, 1979, Loftus, et al.&nbsp;2008). Moreover, validity involves more than just avoiding conscious lying. Dozens of psychological experiments have shown that people often have very limited self-knowledge. We often have no insight into our own motivations. We all engage in unconscious self-justification, and freely confabulate spurious explanations for things we don’t understand (e.g., Wilson, 2002; Ariely, 2009; Kahneman, 2012).</p>
<p>Research in social psychology suggests that parallel problems plague the interviewer. For example, research on hiring practices has shown that unstructured interviews with job candidates actually leads to <em>worse</em> hiring decisions than if no interview occurs (Ross &amp; Nisbett, 2011). As interviewers, we grossly over-estimate our ability to judge character. Past experience (as documented in the resumé), the ability to write (as documented in an application letter), and confidential letters of recommendation are much more predictive of the future success of a candidate than the impressions gained from an open interview (Ross &amp; Nisbett, 2011).</p>
<p>Traditionally, marketing researchers have made the greatest use of interviews in their work. Because of the large amounts of money involved, consumer researchers have been most motivated to “get it right.” Yet in recent years, marketing researchers have become highly suspicious of consumer interviews and focus groups precisely because of the inability of people to accurately introspect (Graves, 2010). People are mostly unaware of their own motivations, and will confidently confabulate answers to any question a researcher may pose.</p>
<p>In his otherwise fine book on interviewing methodology, Robert Weiss offers the following regarding the crucial issue of validity:</p>
<p>“Sometimes, we can check on the validity of a respondent’s account by interviewing other respondents. Occasionally, there are records we can look to for corroboration. But for the most part we must rely on the quality of our interviewing for the validity of our material. Ultimately, our best guarantee of the validity of interview material is careful, concrete level, interviewing within the context of a good interviewing partnership.” (Weiss, 1995)</p>
<p>In short, qualitative researchers don’t have good ways to address the problem of validity. There is a notable tendency among qualitative researchers to avoid discussions about validity.</p>
<p>Because of the close face-to-face interaction, a second problem is that interviews are highly susceptible to investigator bias as well as demand characteristics. Interviews are the virtual antithesis of the double-blind procedure. As a result, confirmation bias is especially problematic. The open interview method has proved especially attractive to those researchers who are motivated by a particular social cause. The more strongly held the political beliefs, the greater the likelihood that the researcher will rely solely on interview methods. Again, qualitative researchers are generally aware of these difficulties, however, little work has been carried out to either measure the magnitude of this bias, or to develop techniques to minimize these confounds.</p>
<p>As Robert Weiss has noted, interviews are more likely to be used by practitioners (social workers, consumer marketers, clinical personnel, political activitists) than by academics, because practitioners are less picky about the quality of their evidence. (See Weiss, 1995; l.3420).</p>
<p>As noted earlier, people find personal stories more compelling than raw statistics. News stories and documentaries are often more effective when they begin or end with a concrete personal example. Interviews can provide vivid case examples whose influence far exceeds the reporting of representative statistics. A danger is that examples can typically be found that seem to illustrate opposite cases. One can find stories of human heroics as well as human cowardice. One can find stories where seat-belts save lives and stories where wearing a seat-belt causes a person’s death. Good research is needed to resolve which account is the more common or representative. Readers and viewers tend to interpret case studies as typical, and regard them as holding important general lessons. Empirical work using representative samples can benefit by recounting an anecdote that illustrates or exemplifies what is found. However, relaying anecdotes that are contrary to the common or typical experience can amount to propaganda. Ideally, exceptional cases will lead to careful thought about how to promote more good results, or minimize bad results. However, policy based on exceptional cases can sometimes make matters worse.</p>
<p>A third and more onerous problem is that qualitative researchers tend to view open interviews as confirmatory research rather than exploratory research. Ideas that arise from interviews are rarely <em>tested.</em> Recall the problem of <em>double-use data</em> where the same data should not be used to both inspire a hypothesis, and as independent evidence in support of that hypothesis. However, it has been common for qualitative researchers to use narrative anecdotes in precisely this way. Said another way, the researcher who relies exclusively on open interviewing is a researcher who never invites failure. Interviews are important starting points for research. But, for the conscientious researcher, interviews cannot be the end point. Open interviews belong as one part in an <em>explore-then-test</em> research program.</p>
