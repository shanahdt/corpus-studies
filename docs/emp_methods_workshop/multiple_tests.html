<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="multiple-tests">Multiple Tests</h4>
<p>In empirical research it’s very common for researchers to use the 95% confidence level—that is, where the significance level (alpha) is .05. If our statistical test produces a <em>p</em> value of .05 or lower, then we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the results are consistent with our research hypothesis.</p>
<p>Notice that a significance level of .05 means that the researcher accepts a 1 in 20 chance of making a Type I error—of claiming something to be true or useful or knowable, when it is in fact false, or useless or unknowable. Now suppose you are browsing through a printed issue of a scholarly journal. The journal contains 20 empirical research articles. Each article reports positive results in testing a single hypothesis. Moreover, suppose that each article reports a <em>p</em> value of .05, and that all of the researchers used a 95% confidence level.</p>
<p>There are twenty significance results published in this issue. Since each of the 20 researchers accepted a 1 in 20 chance of making a Type I error, and since there are 20 statistical tests, on average (just by chance), we would expect one of the articles in the issue to contain spurious results. Just because a study is published, doesn’t make it believable!</p>
<p>Now suppose you were reading a single published article. The article reports statistical tests for 20 hypotheses: the researcher reports that 4 of the hypotheses are statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. Once again, on average, we would expect 1 in 20 tests to reach statistical significance, merely by chance. In other words, the likelihood is that 1 of the 4 positive results reported in the article is spurious.</p>
<p>Now suppose that I run an experiment, whose results turn out to be negative. I know that negative results might arise for all sorts of reasons. Perhaps the reason why it didn’t work is because of poor equipment calibration. I carefully re-calibrate the machine and repeat the experiment. Still, it doesn’t work. The participants report that they find my experiment very boring, and I begin to suspect that my data are less than ideal because the participants are not fully motivated. I decide to cut the number of stimuli in half and compensate for the loss of data by doubling the number of participants. Once again, I re-run the experiment, and once again I end up with negative results. At this point I am suspicious about the quality of my participants. I would like to use better musicians, so I administer a preselection test that allows me to gather data from the subjects who are the most musical. Once again the results turn out to be negative.</p>
<p>With much hard work over several months, I continue to refine my experiment, removing sources of error, aiming for greater reliability in responses, and so on. Finally, after the 20th attempt, I get positive results at the .05 significance level. Hurray! My hard work has finally paid off!</p>
<p>Of course, repeating any experiment 20 times means that, on average, you are likely to get a spurious positive result if your confidence level is 95%. My efforts to “improve” the quality of my experiment may, or may not, have done anything. Just running the experiment multiple times increases the likelihood of producing a spurious positive result.</p>
<p>In all of the above cases, we encounter a problem known as <em>multiple tests</em>: each time you carry out a test, you increase the likelihood of generating a spurious result.</p>
<p>Multiple tests may arise simply by repeating an experiment, or by running several versions of an experiment, or by “tinkering” with various criteria (such as excluding outlier data points) when analyzing your data.</p>
</section>
<section id="controlling-multiple-tests" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="controlling-multiple-tests">Controlling Multiple Tests</h4>
<p>There are four ways to control for multiple tests:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>limiting the number of tests</li>
<li>increasing the confidence level</li>
<li>correcting for the number of tests, and</li>
<li>converging evidence</li>
</ol>
<p>The first way control for multiple tests is to limit the number of tests you perform. Resist the temptation to test many hypotheses. Focus on the most important hypothesis. In general, one should regard one’s data as a <em>finite</em> resource rather than an <em>infinite</em> resource. A data set is much like a battery or a basket of food: each time you use it, you effectively “consume” some of it. A single data set can effectively “wear out” due to multiple tests.</p>
<p>A second approach for dealing with multiple tests is to increase the confidence level. If you choose the 99% confidence level, then, on average, only 1 of 100 tests will produce a spurious result. If you predefine you significance level at .001, then, on average, only 1 of 1,000 tests will be spurious. Notice that if you raise the confidence level, then you will probably have to collect much more data—or you will only find positive results for phenomena that exhibit very large effect sizes.</p>
<p>A third approach allows you to carry out more than one test without having to collect additional data and without having to change the confidence level. In this case, you carry out a mathematical correction for multiple tests. There are several correction methods but the simplest to use is known as the <em>Bonferroni correction.</em> Suppose we want to carry out five tests. Moreover, we want each of the five tests to be done using the 95% confidence level. For a single test, we would look for <em>p</em> values of .05 or less. Suppose that our five hypotheses produce <em>p</em> values of (1) .05, (2) .005, (3) .2, (4) .10, and (5) .01. Without correcting for multiple tests we might conclude that hypotheses 1, 2, and 5 can be accepted. Since we have carried out five tests, the Bonferroni correction would require that we multiply each of the <em>p</em> values by 5. This results in the following “corrected” values: (1) .25, (2) .025, (3) 1.0 (4) .50, and (5) .05. Having corrected for multiple tests, we would conclude that only hypotheses 2 and 5 could be accepted at the 95% confidence level.</p>
<p>In summary, the Bonferroni correction involves multiplying each of the <em>p</em> values by the number of tests you perform. If you perform 10 tests, then multiply your <em>p</em> values by 10 before you determine whether they are smaller than your <em>a priori</em> <em>α</em> level.</p>
<p>The fourth approach to dealing with multiple tests is to collect additional data, preferrably using data from independent research. In short, we aim for <em>converging evidence</em> through replication studies. (Refer to the course document on converging evidence.)</p>
<p>Our slogan simply reminds us to be vigilant for the problem of multiple test, and if present, to correct for the problem:</p>
<p><strong>Slogan:</strong> <em>Correct for multiple tests.</em></p>
</section>
<section id="invisible-multiple-tests" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="invisible-multiple-tests">Invisible Multiple Tests</h4>
<p>Multiple tests are not always immediately apparent. Sometimes we need to be vigilant to recognize situations where multiple tests are occurring.</p>
<p>Research reporting positive results is 2-3 times more likely to get published than research reporting negative results. Moreover, research indicates that researchers are less likely to submit negative reports for publication. This phenomenon is referred to as <em>positive results bias</em>.</p>
<p>Suppose that there is a popular theory—let’s call it <em>Theory A.</em> Researchers in the field think Theory A has a lot of merit: it is conceptually beautiful and makes intuitive sense. A young scholar named Alice is interested in Theory A. She does a literature search and is surprised to find that no experiment has been published testing Theory A. Alice decides to carry out a pertinent experiment. She designs and carries out an experiment, but is disappointed when she gets negative results. She wonders about her design. There are a number of improvements that she might make, but she is discouraged from continuing. Alice abandons the project, takes her data and places it in the bottom drawer of her filing cabinet.</p>
<p>Another scholar, Bill, has been thinking about Theory A. Bill’s dissertation research had assumed that Theory A was true and he’s always been a little uneasy about this assumption. Everyone thinks Theory A is uncontroversial, but Bill’s literature search fails to find any experiment testing Theory A. Bill decides to carry out an experiment with the hope that he can find evidence consistent with Theory A. He designs and carries out an experiment, but is disappointed when he gets negative results. He submits a manuscript to a professional journal, but the reviewers are skeptical. Theory A is conceptually beautiful and makes intuitive sense. There are several ways in which Bill’s experimental method could be improved. The editor of the journal requests a “revise and resubmit.” Bill makes some changes to his method and runs the experiment again. Still, he gets negative results. He knows the journal reviewers will be unhappy that he didn’t implement all of the (sometimes impractical) changes they suggested. Discouraged, he places his manuscript in the bottom drawer of his filing cabinet and goes on to other projects.</p>
<p>Alice and Bill are not alone. Over the years, several scholars attempt to test Theory A without success. There is a good reason why all of these experiments end in failure: Theory A is, in fact, wrong. All of the negative results are telling us something, but because of a positive results bias, the results are hidden from view. This is the <em>file drawer effect.</em></p>
<p>While the file drawer effect is pernicious, the situation can sometimes get even worse. Consider how the story might continue …</p>
<p>Many years later, Zack decides to test Theory A. Zack is not aware of the many other tests that have been done that all ended in failure. Zack carries out the experiment and is thrilled to get positive results at the .05 significance level. Zack immediately submits the results to a prestigious journal. The journal reviewers are delighted to see a study that “confirms” a widely loved Theory A, and the journal Editor is thrilled to publish an article what will surely become frequently cited. There is only one problem. In reality, Theory A is wrong, and Zack has had the misfortune of getting spurious results. Repeat an experiment enough times, and one is bound to get spurious statistically significant results. Dozens of previous experiments resulted in negative results. Zack’s experiment is really part of a pattern of multiple testing: the <em>p</em> value in Zack’s experiment ought to be corrected for the many earlier tests of Theory A. But Zack (and everyone else) is unaware of all of the other tests that have been carried out by other researchers. The <em>file drawer effect</em> has become a version of the <em>multiple tests</em> problem—one that is aggrevated by <em>positive results bias.</em></p>
<p>In the bad old days, pharmaceutical companies would sometimes engage in clandestine multiple tests. When a company develops a drug, they need to carry out clinical trials in order to establish whether or not the drug is <em>safe</em> and <em>effective.</em> The data they collect is then sent to the Food and Drug Administration who will approve (or deny) the sale of the drug. So-called “Phase 1” trials are carried out simply to determine whether the drug is safe and doesn’t have onerous side-effects. There is no incentive for drug companies to cheat on Phase 1 trials because an unsafe drug will ultimately lead to expensive lawsuits. The temptation to cheat happens in later phases, where the aim is to establish whether the drug is <em>effective</em>—that is, whether the drug has any beneficial effects. If the drug is safe, but ineffective, the company can still make considerable profit because people want to believe it is useful. In several historical cases, the pharmaceutical company would commission multiple clinical trials. For example, perhaps 10 clinical trials would be started. After the trials were completed, however, the pharmacetical company would inform the FDA about the results of only 3 or 4 trials. They would simply fail to report results suggesting that the drug was ineffective.</p>
<p>These sorts of deceptions are now impossible because the various regulatory agencies (like the European Medicines Agency and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) do not accept any clinical data unless the clinical trial is first registered. That is, pharmacetical researchers must report their intention to start a clinical trial before they start. The various drug and medicines agencies follow up each experiment in order to determine whether the results are negative or positive.</p>
<p>Sometimes multiple tests are not recognized by a researcher. Suppose, for example, you have a set of sound stimuli in which you are interested in the effect of a certain manipulation on perceived emotional content. You ask listeners to judge a number of different affective states: happy, ecstatic, sad, grief, tender, aggressive, dramatic, relaxing, inspiring, contemplative, etc. If you test each affect separately, then you will have to correct for multiple tests.</p>
<p>Inexperienced researchers will sometimes go on a “fishing expedition” in which they test many different hypotheses against the data they have collected. For example, the researcher may test 30 or 40 hypotheses. However, only two or three hypotheses produce significant results. They then craft a paper “testing” these two or three hypotheses without ever mentioning that they tested a large number of other hypotheses. We might call these <em>unreported tests</em>.</p>
<p>Incidentally, it is okay for researchers to engage in such “fishing expeditions” if the activity is reported as <em>exploratory</em> research rather than <em>hypothesis testing</em> research. For example, you might carry out 30 tests on a set of data, and find two (seemingly) statistically significant results. Given the number of tests carried out, there is a good chance that either one or both of these results are spurious. However, you might be sufficiently intrigued to carry out a separate study whose purpose is explicitly to <em>test</em> one or both of these hypotheses. In other words, we can “mine” a data set for new ideas, that are then independently tested (i.e., explore-then-test).</p>

<section id="community-fears" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="community-fears">Community Fears</h4>
<p>Consider the hypothetical town of Kleinburg (population 2,000). Kleinburg is a happy place until one day, an administrator in the local hospital notices that there seems to have been an unusually large number of cases of liver cancer. Looking up statistics at the National Institutes for Health, the administator is shocked to discover that Kleinburg has an incidence of liver cancer <em>eight times</em> higher than the national average and has the highest rate in the state. Soon the whole town is alive with gossip and suspicion. Attention soon gravitates to the natural gas plant on the edge of town.</p>
<p>There may be reason for concern. Or there may not be. In any room full of people, someone has to be the tallest person. Someone will have the longest hair, the darkest eyes, and the biggest feet. Similarly, in any country, by definition there will be some town or municipality that has the highest rate of heart disease. Another town will have the highest rate of gall stones, and another will have the highest incidence of ingrown toe-nails. Different places will have the highest rate of insurance fraud, bank imbezzlement, copper wire theft, color blindness, and jaywalking. There are thousands of bad things that can happen, and the fact that one town is the worst of many is to be expected. What then, do we make of the fact that the incidence of liver cancer in Kleinburg is eight times the national average?</p>
<p>In a group of ten people, one may well find a person who weighs three times as much as the lightest person. But if we expand the sample to 1,000 people, then one is likely to find a person who weighs eight times as much as the lightest person. There are 2,155 towns and cities in Germany, with many thousands more small villages and hamlets. Simply by natural chance variation, one may expect to find a municipality that has a liver cancer rate that is eight times the national average. The probability of this increases as the size of the town gets smaller. In a hamlet consisting of 50 people, a single case of liver cancer represents a stunning 2% rate.</p>
<p>In effect, statistics for towns and villages amount to multiple tests. With enough places in a country, natural variation is bound to result in some (seemingly) highly suspicious coincidences. The greater the number of observations, the greater the likelihood of finding something that might imply that something truly bad is going on. If we know that something has a probability of only occuring once in 10,000, then that something has probably happened in one of the 10,000 villages in Germany.</p>
<p>So what are we to make of the liver cancer incidence in Kleinburg? Statisticians know to look at other factors. If the natural gas plant is releasing carcinogens, then one would expect to see other cancers, not just liver cancers. What is the incidence of stomach cancer, bone cancer, leukemia, and other cancers in Kleinburg? If the incidence of other cancers are similarly elevated then there is a greater likelihood that something bad is indeed going on. However, if the incidence of liver cancer is the only elevated observation, then it is mostly likely a simple consequence of a small sample of people in a large number of villages.</p>
<p>It rarely occurs to people that some town will contain people with bigger feet than any other town in the country. The reasons for these differences may be quite uninteresting. Big numbers increase the likelihood of observing something bizarre. Small numbers increase the likelihood of observing large differences between samples.</p>
