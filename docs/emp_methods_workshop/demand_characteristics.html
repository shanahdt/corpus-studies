<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="demand-characteristics">Demand Characteristics</h3>
<hr>
<p>“It is to the highest degree probable that the subject[’s] … general attitude of mind is that of ready complacency and cheerful willingness to assist the investigator in every possible way by reporting to him those very things which he is most eager to find, and that the very questions of the experimenter … suggest the shade of reply expected” (Pierce, 1908).</p>
<p>Earlier, we considered the general problem of <em>reactivity</em> where the presence of an observer changes the behavior of the person observed. When carrying out an experiment with human participants, participants will tend to form their own ideas about the purpose of the experiment. In some cases, the participant will correctly infer the aim, but in many cases, the participant’s idea will be wrong. Right or wrong, what a participant thinks about an experiment can often (though not always) shape their behaviors in ways that may confound the experiment. This type of reactivity is referred to in experimental research as <em>demand characteristics</em>.</p>
<p>A <em>demand characteristic</em> is any aspect of the experiment (apart from the experimental manipulation) that causes a change in the participant’s behavior. Demand characteristics often add undesirable confounds to a study, so it is important to be able to identify and minimize possible demand characteristics.</p>
<p>Demand characteristics do not merely arise because a participant <em>thinks</em> about the experiment. Demand characteristics can also be entirely unconscious. One of the most powerful examples of a demand characteristic is the <em>placebo effect</em>. The simple expectation that the placebo will improve one’s situation that leads to the placebo actually improving one’s situation.</p>
<section id="cooperation-bias" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cooperation-bias">Cooperation Bias</h4>
<p>In many experiments, participants are often eager to please the experimenter. It is human nature to want to be cooperative. Even if you don’t tell the participant what you are <em>hoping</em> to observe, they may still form an opinion about what answers you might find pleasing.</p>
<p>Related to social desirability bias is <em>cooperation bias</em>. Here, the participant is eager to be perceived by the researcher as cooperative (Orne, 1962). In this case, the participant is apt to respond according to what they believe the experimenter wants to hear. Research suggests that cooperation bias differs between cultures. For example, research suggests that people from Asian cultures tend to behave in a more cooperative manner than people from American culture (Nisbett, 2003).</p>
</section>
<section id="contrarian-bias" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="contrarian-bias">Contrarian Bias</h4>
<p>Not every participant is susceptible to cooperation bias. Participants can also become suspicious of the experimenter’s aim. The participant may form an opinion (either accurate or not) about the nature of the hypothesis being tested, and feel that the hypothesis is wrong or wrong-headed. Accordingly, participants may also behave in a manner <em>contrary</em> what they think you are doing.</p>
</section>
<section id="acquiescence-bias" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="acquiescence-bias">Acquiescence Bias</h4>
<p>Apart from attempting to please the experimenter, people often respond in ways that favor <em>positive</em> rather than <em>negative</em> responses. This reactivity problem commonly occurs in interviews and surveys and is referred to as <em>acquiescence bias</em>. When asked whether they agree or disagree with various statements some respondents will favor the “yes” response over the “no” response — even if it is causes them to behave in a contradictory fashion. For example, at different points in a long questionnaire, a person may agree with both of the following statements: <em>I prefer a cup of coffee to a glass of water.</em> <em>I prefer a glass of water to a cup of coffee.</em> (Messick &amp; Jackson, 1961).</p>
<p>Acquiescence bias is frequently observed when people don’t understand what they are being asked. Travelers in a foreign culture often encounter this. A monolingual English speaker traveling in Egypt might ask a local person: “To get to the pyramids, do I turn left or right?” To which a local person might well answer “Yes.”</p>
</section>
<section id="social-desirability-bias" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="social-desirability-bias">Social Desirability Bias</h4>
<p>Another problem is <em>social desirabiliy bias</em>. Research shows that we commonly answer questions in a way that makes us appear to be better persons. We exaggerate charitable and altruistic traits, and minimize negative self-portrayals (Crowne &amp; Marlowe, 1960).</p>
<p>We aren’t simply interested in making others view us favorably. We are also eager to view ourselves positively. Once again, research shows that we hide from ourselves our bad behaviors and attitudes, and perpetually interpret our thoughts and behaviors from the most positive perspective.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-story" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-story">A Story</h4>
<p>In 1990 I carried out an experiment to test whether listeners are prejudice against women composers. I expected that people will tend to view women composers less favorably than male composers. I had student participants listen to excerpts of recordings of relatively obscure modernist works. For each work, I had reproduced old program notes that described aspects of the pieces. I had made slight changes to the program notes so that they would subtley indicate whether the composer was male, female, or of indeterminate gender. I was concerned about demand characteristics, so I made special efforts to ensure that the gender indicators were quite subtle. For example, consistent with typical concerts, most of the excerpts were assigned to male genders.</p>
<p>The experiment was a between-subjects design in which one group heard certain passages assigned to certain genders, whereas the other group was led to the impression that the composers of the same passages were of the opposite gender. Would listeners rate a musical passage as being of less quality because the composer was a woman? Were men more likely than women to exhibit such a bias?</p>
<p>The results were quite clear. The implied sex of the composer made no difference whatsoever on the assessed quality of the music. I was frankly surprised by the results. A couple of weeks after the end of the experiment, I happened to interact with one of my students in the hallway. Our discussion turned to the experiment. I asked him what he thought was the purpose of the experiment. Subsequent conversations with other student participants confirmed what the first student had told me: “It seemed pretty obvious that you were trying to determine whether we were prejudiced against women composers.” All of the students I talked to had correctly inferred what I was up to.</p>
</section>
<section id="minimizing-demand-characteristics" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="minimizing-demand-characteristics">Minimizing Demand Characteristics</h4>
<p>Broadly speaking, there are eight ways to minimizing or eliminate demand characteristics: (1) field observation, (2) blind procedure, (3) deception, (4) double-blind procedure, (5) confidence building, (6) between subjects design, (7) implicit measures, and (8) debriefing.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Field Observation.</strong> Anthropologists commonly rely on ethnographic fieldwork, however they typically interact or participate in social and interpersonal activities in which their presence as researchers is not hidden or disguised. By field observation, we mean clandestine observation in naturalistic situations where people are observed without their awareness.</p>
<p>A classic example of such an approach is found in Simha Arom’s experiments with scales in the Central African Republic. Arom was interested to learn which tuning system was preferred by his African xylophone musicians. He constructed a xylophone-like instrument that was actually a MIDI synthesizer with several different tuning systems. Arom was eager to know what the musicians preferred, without them being influenced by his presence. So he set up a video camera near the instrument and left the musicians to play with the instruments without them being aware that they were being recorded. On the video, two musicians are recorded as saying “It’s all the same.” “There’s no difference [between the different tuning systems].”</p>
<p>Another example of field observation is Olaf Post’s (2011) study of audience behaviors at the Concertgebouw concert hall in Amsterdam. Using archived video recordings of concerts, Post was able to examine the figetting behaviors (scratching noses, cross-legs, etc.) of audience members. He then related the amount of figetting to the type of music being played — and to structural features of the music. In this case, the members of the audience were clearly unaware that they were being videoed In thise case, even if the members of the audience were aware of the presence of the video camera, they were surely unaware that their figetting behavior was being monitored.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Blind procedure.</strong> An experiment is said to use a blind procedure either (1) when the participant is not told about the purpose of the experiment, or (2) when the participant is not aware whether they are in a control or experimental group. In drug research, for example, participants are commonly divided into two groups: the experimental group and the control group. The <em>experimental group</em> receives the actual drug being tested. The <em>control group</em> is given a placebo — an inert “sugar” pill. If participants are randomly assigned to the control and experimental conditions, then it is likely that both groups will show equivalent cooperation or contrarian bias — and so observed differences between the experimental and control conditions are less likely to be artifacts of demand characteristics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deception.</strong> Since participants may sometimes infer the true purpose of the study (even without being told), it is sometimes useful to lead the participant to conclude that the experiment is about something else. The researcher may explicitly lie about the purpose, or implicitly lead the participant to infer that the experiment has a different purpose.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Double Blind Procedure.</strong> When both the experimenter and the participant are unaware of the purpose of the experiment, the experiment is said to be double blind. Double blind experiments are especially useful when the experimenter is required to make some subjective interpretation. For example, in music-education research, an experimenter may be required to assess whether or not a musician has improved. If the experimenter knows whether the musician is in the experimental-curriculum or control group, this is likely to lead to experimenter bias. It is better if both the musician-participant and the experimenter don’t know whether the participant is in the intervention condition or in the control condition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Confidence Building.</strong> Especially when participants are disposed to behave in a cooperative fashion, participants are less likely to be influenced by demand characteristics if you boost their self-confidence. If they are confident, then they are more likely to feel comfortable with their own opinions/judgments, rather than attempting to respond in a way that they think will please the experimenter.</p>
<p>Confidence-building can be done in five basic ways.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>Employing tasks that are relatively easy for the participant. (This might be purposely done toward the beginning of the experiment, where subsequent tasks become more difficult.) The simplicity of the task raises the self-confidence of the participant by making them aware of their own mastery.</p></li>
<li><p>Encouraging self-confidence through verbal feedback: “You seem to be really good at this task.” “You were selected for this experiment because of your background and expertise.” Such feedback may be honest or deceptive. That is, even if a participant is not especially good at the task, such positive feedback will still boost their self-confidence and reduce the likelihood of them looking to echo what they think the experimenter wants.</p></li>
<li><p>Emphasizing that there is no “right” or “wrong” answer, etc. and that we are genuinely interested in the participant’s unique view, opinion, or experience. Task instructions can be worded to reinforce this. For example, instead of asking “Which musical passage sounds better?” Ask “Which musical passage do you think sounds better?”</p></li>
<li><p>Behaving in a deferential way toward the participant, or reducing the appearance of being an authority figure. A participant who feels they are socially equal to, or superior to the experimenter is more likely to respond honestly. For many participants, if the experimenter is an older male professor dressed in a white lab coat using formal language with a deep confident voice, then participants may be more likely to respond in a way that conforms to what the participant thinks the experimenter wants. Conversely, for many participants, if the experimenter is a younger female student dressed casually using colloquial language with a tentative insecure voice, then participants may be more likely to respond honestly. Along with dress, attitude, language, age and sex, physical setting also plays a role: people will feel more self-confident at home than in a laboratory environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Employing tasks that are not socially or politically charged. For example, asking “Which of these two tones has a longer duration?” is likely to incur fewer demand characteristics than asking “Which of these musical styles is better?”</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Within- and Between-Subjects Designs.</strong> Recall dependent and independent variables. The <em>independent variable</em> (the one the experimenter manipulates) was whether the composer for a selection was deemed male or female. <em>Within-Subjects Design.</em> (what I used in my composer prejudice study). When the dependent variable is manipulated across its range for each each subject. <em>Between-Subjects Design.</em> when the dependent variable is fixed for each subject, but varies between subjects. E.g. Here are some excerpts of contemporary music, all written by women composers. Rate how good they are.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implicit Measures.</strong> Some kinds of dependent measures are less susceptible than others to demand characteristics. In particular, <em>self-reports</em> are often easiest to collect, but they are the easiest to be confounded by demand characteristics. There are several types of implicit measures, but one of the best is <em>reaction-time</em> (speed of response), since participants have no time to “think.”.</p>
<p>Are you prejudiced against women or blacks? Virtually no one admits that they are prejudiced — even if their behaviors indicate that there are underlying predilections and biases. A useful technique for identifying a person’s preconceptions is the <em>implicit association test</em> (IAT).</p>
<p>Suppose that you are interested whether people think that Native Americans are viewed as less “American” than white Americans. The implicit association test allows you to glimpse such prejudices. First, you begin with a series of photographs of people. Half of the photographs are of people who are obviously white and half are of people who are obviously native Americans. The task is simply to respond as quickly as possible to whether the faces are white or native-American. Next, we give you a task consisting of place names. Here the participant is asked to respond as quickly as possible to whether the place names are foreign or American. Again, the task is straightforward with places such as Seattle, France, Ohio, Russia, Miami, and Oslo. These tasks establish a person’s baseline reaction-times for identifying “white,” “native,” “foreign,” and “American.”</p>
<p>Now same tasks joined together. Press one key if image is either a white person or an American placename; press a different key if the image is either a native-American person or a foreign placename. Finally, the reverse pairings are made: press one key if the image is either of a white person or a foreign placename; press a different key if the image is either a native-American or an American placename.</p>
<p>In this task, if a person tends to unconsciously think of Native Americans as less American than a white person, then they will tend to exhibit faster responses when Native+foreign are linked, and slower responses when Native+American are linked. Similarly, they will tend to exhibit faster responses when white+American are linked, and slower responses when white+foreign are linked.</p>
<p>Do people tend to associate blacks with crime? Arabs with terrorism? Reggae music with drugs? The <em>implicit association test</em> has been widely used to investigate a wide range of associations and unconscious prejudices. You can take some of these tests yourself at https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/demo/</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Debriefing.</strong> The best method for becoming aware of demand characteristics is through the post-experiment interview. After an experiment, sit down with the participant and ask them to describe their experience. Begin with the most general questions: “How did it go?” “Did you find it easy or difficult?” “Did you have a strategy for doing this task?” The idea is simply to get the participant to talk about their experience. Try to avoid asking leading questions. Simply be vigilant for comments that suggests that the participant misunderstood the instructions, or was using a strategy you hadn’t imagined. If necessary, begin to ask them more direct questions: “What do you think of the experiment?” “What do you think the purpose of the experiment is?” These sorts of questions might alert you to some unanticipated demand characteristics.</p>
<p>The value of debriefing is evident in a study by Huron, Kinney &amp; Precoda (2006). The study was intended to test the conjecture that low transpositions of melodies are hear as more aggressive than high transpositions of the same melodies. One participant was asked to judge how aggressive each melody sounded. In the debriefing, one participant remarked:</p>
<p>“Some of the melodies were quite low, and I thought it was obvious that lower melodies would sound more aggressive, so I discounted that and tried to focus on the melody itself, and what would make it sound aggressive.”</p>
<p>Although the participant hadn’t inferred the purpose of the experiment, she nevertheless regarded the main effect as obvious, and so answered in a way in which she thought controlled for the very effect we were anticipating. In this case, we used the results of the post-experiment interview to eliminate that person’s data from the analysis. Moreover, this was done <em>before looking at any of the data.</em></p>
<p>Notice that debriefing does not reduce demand characteristics. Instead, debriefing alerts you to the possible existence of demand characteristics. Debriefing is cheap and easy to do.</p></li>
