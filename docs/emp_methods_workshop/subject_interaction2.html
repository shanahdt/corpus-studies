<section id="interacting-with-human-participants" class="level1">
<h1>Interacting with Human Participants</h1>
<p>Interacting with human subjects involves a combination of <em>legal</em>, <em>moral</em>, <em>experimental</em>, and <em>educational</em> considerations. Four goals shape the experimenter’s interaction with a participant:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>ensuring the physical and psychological well-being of the participants</li>
<li>collecting high quality experimental data with a minimum of confounds</li>
<li>providing a learning opportunity for participants</li>
<li>providing a learning opportunity for the experimenter about possible unanticipated confounds and insights pertinent to the research.</li>
</ol>
<p><span id="Experience"></span></p>
<section id="participants-experience" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="participants-experience">Participant’s Experience</h2>
<p>Whether the participant is paid or unpaid, a student or non-student, it is important that the participant have a meaningful and informative experience. Not all experiments are inherently interesting, but it is possible for a participant to understand how participating in an otherwise boring task might produce research results of great interest and value.</p>
<p>If a participant has a negative experience, this indicates a failure of the experiment. Moreover, if a participant has a negative experience, it reflects poorly on our research program, and may make it difficult to recruit participants for future studies.</p>
<p>One of the most egregious assumptions experimenters make is to assume that other people are just like us (i.e., <a href="http://csml.som.ohio-state.edu/Music829C/methodological.potholes.html#egocentric%20bias">egocentric bias</a>). Experimental research has established that not all people experience the world the same way. It is important not to assume that the participant is having the experience you think they are.</p>
<p>Consider the following extreme case. The population of university undergraduate students corresponds demographically with the age group showing the greatest susceptibility to schitzophrenia. Roughly 1 in 200 students is likely to exhibit schitzophrenic symptoms. If you run enough subjects, you are likely to encounter a person who is schitzophrenic. YOU may think that the experiment is innocent and innocuous, but a schitzophrenic may experience the experiment as threatening and sinister.</p>
<p>Throughout the experiment be vigilant for any signs that your participant is having a negative experience. The physical and mental welfare of the participant is your most important responsibility. If you deem that the participant is at mental or physical risk, or if the participant reports any negative feelings or concerns, stop the experiment (if it is safe to do so). If you inadvertently cause harm to your subject, do not attempt to cover up the problem or make light of it. Covering up a mistake will result in more onerous disciplinary actions than reporting an honest error. Should any untoward episode occur, contact Dr.&nbsp;Huron immediately in order to fill out an <a href="http://www.orrp.ohio-state.edu/forms/aeforms.doc"><em>Adverse Event Form</em></a> for the Institutional Review Board. Reporting such events is mandatory.</p>
<p><span id="Procedure"></span></p>
</section>
<section id="procedure" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="procedure">Procedure</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Prepare</strong>. Before running an experiment be sure you are fully acquainted with the equipment, instructions, and procedures for the experiment. Unless the experiment is a minor variant of a previous experiment, you should practice running the experiment on a friend, colleague, or assistant. Check the technical set-up.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Blind</strong>. In some experiments, different participants will receive different treatments (i.e.&nbsp;“between-subjects design”). If possible, organize the experiment so that you do not know which treatment the subject will receive. Remaining “blind” to the experimental treatment will help ensure that your interaction with the participant doesn’t bias the results. If more than one person is involved in running participant for a between-subjects design, avoid the possibility that one experimenter tends to run subjects in one condition, while a different experimenter tends to run subjects in another condition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Introduce</strong>. Introduce yourself. Tell the person your name and indicate your position or status. For example, you might say “Hi, my name is _____; I’m a /student/graduate student/visiting scholar/post-doctoral fellow/ working here in the music department.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interact</strong>. Endeavor to make the participant feel at ease. They are entering what they perceive as “your space”, and may feel that they are merely cogs in some impersonal research machine. Interact with your participant. Address them by name.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assess</strong>. Use your interaction to get a sense of whether the participant is nervous, or in a hurry, excited, depressed, or out-of-breath. Ask the participant how their day is going; ask whether they feel “up” for an experiment. If the participant has a cold or is otherwise ill, they are not likely to enjoy the experience; and they are not likely to provide good data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inform</strong>. Tell the participant about the experiment in accordance with the approved Human Subjects protocol. Describe the stimuli they will hear, the nature of the task, and remind them of the duration of the experiment. Ask them whether they have any questions. If the subject asks about the specific goal of the experiment, respond by (1) telling him or her about the broad goals of this field of research, (2) indicate that you prefer not to reveal the specific theory or hypothesis you are testing, but that (3) you will tell them exactly what you are doing following the end of the experiment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Written Consent</strong>. When a consent form is required, hand the participant a clip-board with the consent form. Do not read the consent form aloud, since this will interfere with the subject’s own reading speed. Sit down. Use your body language to signal that you are not in a hurry, and that taking time to read the consent form is what is expected. Many people will not actually read the form; some will sign it immediately without reading. In either case, tell them that the form says they are free to terminate the experiment at any time without prejudice. Also tell them that you can provide them with a copy of the form if they wish. Nearly all Institutional Review Boards will require these two instructions. In addition, tell the participant that the resulting data from this experiment will be stored in an anonymous format, and that no one will know that the data came from them. Tell them that you may make the data available to other scholars for further study.</p>
<p>N.B. Debriefings of past subjects indicates that in our music experiments, the most stressful on-site experience for participants is <em>signing the consent form.</em> Most people are naturally skeptical of signing a document. The fact that a signature is required tends to make them wary and wonder what is in store. Resist the temptation to tell them that there are no appreciable physical or psychological risks. If they seem concerned, it is better to end the experiment — provided you think it is safe to stop.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Verbal Consent</strong>. If the IRB-approved experimental protocol does not require a written consent form, you must still obtain <em>verbal consent</em> from your participant before proceding with the experiment. When no consent form is involved, you are still required to convey two pieces of information: (1) Tell the participant your name, and that you are representing the Principal Investigator who is a lecturer/professor/member-of-staff employed at your instution. (You should have already done this when you introduced yourself; see above.) (2) Tell the participant that they are free to terminate the experiment at any time without prejudice or penalty. In addition, tell the participant that the resulting data from this experiment will be stored in an anonymous format, and that no one will know that the data came from them. Tell them that we may make the data available to other scholars for further study.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Check</strong>. Ensure that they have signed the consent form before proceeding with the experiment. Also ensure that they have printed their name on the form. Signatures are often unreadable, and we need to know the subject’s name in order to maintain a complete consent record. For student’s participating in the Music Research Program, a clear name is need in order to ensure that they receive credit. Add the correct date if the participant hasn’t already written this on the form. The form also requires a witness — your signature. It is often convenient to wait until after the experiment is underway before you add your signature to the form. Since you have observed the participant sign the form, there is nothing wrong with witnessing the signature some minutes later.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Situate</strong>. Seat the participant in the appropriate place. Make sure they are comfortable. Especially tall or short people may require some adjustment of the apparatus, such as keyboard height. Ensure that there are no potentially dangerous impediments such as scissors, electrical cables, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Instruct</strong>. Read the formal instructions for the experiment. Often, these instructions will appear on a computer screen. Since participants often “skim” over any printed instructions, it is prudent to read the instructions aloud from the screen while the subject follows the written script. You might begin by saying “Let’s just go over the instructions here …” Aim to read the instructions in a consistent voice for all subjects. If you find it useful to embellish the instructions, use the same language for each participant and record in your lab book the exact words you use.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Practice</strong>. For most experiments, there will be an initial set of practice trials. Don’t hover over the participant while they do the practice trials. Go away and let the subject continue on their own. With experience, you’ll have a good idea of how long to wait before you return. When the practice trials are completed, ask the subject whether they have any questions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Query</strong>. Most participants won’t have any questions to ask at this point. If the subject asks a question, make a mental note of the question. Later, include the question in your experimental notes. Such questions can help identify ways to improve the experimental set-up. Subjects’ questions may also alert you to possible misinterpretations of the instructions. For example, you may be unaware that there is some ambiguity in the instructions, and that some subjects may be responding in a way you hadn’t anticipated. Finally, such questions may later prove helpful in identifying data that should be excluded from the final analysis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Respond</strong>. When answering subject’s questions, try to avoid giving them extra insights into the experimental hypothesis. Be careful in your choice of words. Say as much as needed in order for the subject to feel they understand.</p>
<p>If you re-explain the instructions, be wary if the subject says s/he now understands. After repeating an explanation, it is common for a confused subject to claim s/he understands in order not to be perceived as stupid.</p>
<p>Make a mental note of the exact words you used to clarify the instructions. Include your response in your experimental notes. Be accurate. If you said something you shouldn’t have, be honest in reporting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Privacy</strong>. Try to avoid “hovering” nearby during an experiment. Unless the experiment explicitly requires you to observe or interact with the subject, you should leave the room or leave the subject alone.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Remind</strong>. Just before the main experiment starts, remind the subject about the approximate length of the experiment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stay</strong>. Don’t go too far away. Occasionally, a subject will stop the experiment before the end. Sometimes this is for a good reason — such as an equipment failure, or the decision of the subject to leave. In rare cases, a subject will stop to get a drink of water or ask you a question. If the subject wants to continue with the experiment, use your judgment in determining whether the experiment should resume.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wrap-up</strong>. Following the end of the experiment, six tasks remain that involve interacting with the subject: (1) debriefing, (2) confessing, (3) educating, (4) paying, (5) thanking, and (6) soliciting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Debrief</strong>. Debriefing is an essential part of the experiment. The goal of debriefing is to gather information about the experiment from the subject’s point-of-view. “Did you have a strategy you were using for this experiment?” “Did you simply follow your intuitions, or did you follow a particular way of doing the task?” Let the subject talk about his/her experience. What did they think about the experiment? Were they able to concentrate on the task? Did they find the task easy or hard?</p>
<p>In one experiment, we were looking to see if phrases played in low transpositions are perceived as being “heavier” than mid-register or high transpositions. When debriefing one subject, he mentioned that pitch-height was an obvious factor influencing whether the phrase sounds heavy or light. Consequently, he said that he explicitly ignored the overall pitch height and made his judgments of “heaviness” on other factors! In this case, the debriefing provided critical information that allowed us to avoid using this data in our analysis.</p>
<p>In many experiments, it may be necessary to discard some collected data depending on certain criteria. For example, subjects who do not achieve a certain minimum performance level, or subjects who have certain skills. After a subject completes an experiment, do not then tell the subject that you are likely to throw away their data. Participants are understandably discouraged when they learn that their data is unusable.</p>
<p>Finally, ask the subject if there was anything about their experience that was stressful, annoying, painful or uncomfortable. Immediately inform Dr.&nbsp;Huron if the subject reports any negative experience.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Confess.</strong> Occasionally an experiment will involve deception. Deception cannot occur without explicit approval by the Institutional Review Board. When deception is used, an approved <em>Debriefing Script</em> is usually mandated. Read the script explaining the nature and purpose of the deception. Ask them if they have any questions about why the deception was necessary. If a subject is upset by the deception, do not attempt to make light of the situation. If the subject expresses any negative feelings about the deception, inform that subject that they are free to file a complaint with the Institutional Review Board.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Educate</strong>. If your participants do not receive payment, or if research participation is a requirement for some class, then it is usually appropriate to reciprocate by doing something useful for the participant. In educational settings, we interpret this as a goal to educate music students (and other participants) regarding experimental approaches to music scholarship. Simply participating in an experiment will convey some idea of what’s involved. However, apart from this, it is valuable to explain more about an experiment. You can explain the purpose of the experiment and say something about what you expect to find. You might describe the different types of stimuli used or describe the method used in the experiment (e.g.&nbsp;method of adjustment, 2AFC, etc.). Identify the independent and dependent variables. Give the participant an opportunity to ask questions about the purpose and methods of the experiment. Some participants will be in a hurry to leave. Tell them that it is okay for them to leave, but that part of our goal is to educate students about experimental research in music. Indicate that you are prepared to converse.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pay</strong>. If the subject is receiving payment, deliver the appropriate cash, and have them sign a receipt. If there is reimbursement for parking, this needs to be indicated on the receipt.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Thank</strong>. Thank your participant. Tell your subject how important s/he is in the research program, and that you are genuinely grateful for their participation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Solicit</strong>. Solicit the cooperation of the subject not to disclose any information about the experiment to their friends or class mates. Explain why this is important.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Clean-up</strong>. After the subject has left, six tasks remain: (1) recording, (2) crediting, (3) restoring, (4) securing, (5) backing up, and (6) reporting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Record</strong>. When the participant has left, take time to record pertinent points made during the subject debriefing. Record any strategies, complications, or other subject comments. Also record any observations you may have made about the participant: Was the subject excited, sleepy, unattentive, etc.?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Credit</strong>. For participants who are part of a subject pool, be sure to record their participation so they can receive proper credit. Remember that credit is earned whether or not the student completes the experiment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Restore</strong>. Return furniture, equipment and computer systems to their original state. Ensure that other people can use the lab and that other experiments can be run.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure</strong>. Secure all data and personal information. File the consent form in the appropriate place. Make sure there is no personal information lying around (such as names, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses) that might be accessed by unauthorized individuals. Remove subject contact information from your schedule or smart-phone. Remove identifying information from data files according to the IRB-approved Protocol for the experiment. When throwing out pieces of paper consider whether the paper should be shredded. Log-out from the computer so that data can’t be accessed when you aren’t around.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Backup</strong>. Make backup copies of important data in accordance with the IRB-approved Protocol for the experiment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Report</strong>. Report any failures to comply with the IRB-approved Protocol for the experiment.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>One of the most difficult issues in interacting with experimental subjects is striking the right balance between formality and informality. From an experimental standpoint, the ideal would be to follow a written script for everything you say. This would ensure that each participant is treated in an identical way and reduces unconscious experimenter bias. However, it is not good for a participant to feel they are interacting with a machine rather than a human being. With practice, an experimenter can convey a sense of friendly informality while behaving in a nearly identical manner with each participant.</p>
