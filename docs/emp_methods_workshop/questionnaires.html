<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="designing-questionnaires">Designing Questionnaires</h3>
<hr>
<p>A common approach to survey research is the <em>questionnaire</em>. Questionnaires are more formal than interviews, but less formal than experiments. At the formal end, questionnaires can morph into experiments. At the informal end, questionnaires can morph into open interviews.</p>
<p>Surveys may be conducted using printed documents, web-based questionnaires, or oral surveys conducted in person or via telephone. When the responses are hand-written or typed (on a computer), the survey is usually referred to as a <em>questionnaire.</em></p>
<section id="questionnaire-advice" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="questionnaire-advice">Questionnaire Advice</h4>
<p>The most common problems with questionnaires: (1) lack of clarity about the purpose, (2) unrepresentative sampling, (3) leading questions, and (4) uncontrolled demand characteristics.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><em>Establish the type of study.</em> Before beginning a survey/questionnaire, decide what kind of study you are proposing. Is this an exploratory study, a descriptive study, or a correlational study? Though rare, it is possible to conduct a bona fide <em>experiment</em> using a survey/questionnaire method in which the experimenter manipulates some variable.[1] In general, surveys are exploratory or correlational.</p>
<p>Are you testing an <em>a priori</em> hypothesis? For example, you might have the hypothesis that people who enjoy non-Western music exhibit greater “openness” as a personality trait. In this case you will need to include questions from a personality inventory that assess “openness” as well as questions that determine musical tastes and listening habits. Your questionnaire would therefore be a correlational study testing an <em>a priori</em> hypothesis.</p>
<p>Do not begin designing the survey or questionnaire until you have a clear idea about the goals. Do not distribute a questionnaire before you have a clear plan for how you plan to analyze the data.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Limit the number of questions.</em> Don’t squander the patience of your respondents by asking too many questions.</p>
<p>If the questionnaire is intended to test one or more hypotheses then include only those questions necessary for testing. Avoid the temptation to add questions for vague or nebulous reasons.</p>
<p>In the case of exploratory studies there is more latitude to ask questions. Since the purpose of an exploratory study is to invite new ideas and unanticipated observations, it is appropriate to “go fishing”—asking questions simply to see what happens. Nevertheless, avoid squandering the patience of your respondents.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Use lure questions to reduce demand characteristics.</em> In some cases, the researcher may be concerned that respondents will infer the purpose of the questionnaire—introducing unwanted demand characteristics. It is sometimes useful to add “lure questions” whose role is to prevent respondents from guessing the true purpose of the study. A lure question is a question that is utterly irrelevant to the purpose of the study — a question that is intended to make respondents think that the purpose of the study is something else. For example, you might be interested in differences in listening behaviors between males and females. The structure of the questionnaire might make it easy for people to see that that is the purpose. Consequently, you might consider asking questions about pets, or travel experiences, or some other irrelevant topic in order to reduce the likelihood that participants will guess the true goal of the study. Lure questions are a form of mild deception.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Start with easy questions.</em> Respondents can become frustrated with a questionnaire or survey, and this may cause them to abandon the task before completion. A helpful strategy is to place easy questions at the beginning of the questionnaire. For example, asking a person’s age, sex, native language, country of birth, etc. As respondents answer more questions, they will tend to feel committed to the task, and so feel a greater sense of obligation to finish the questionnaire.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Give feedback about the length.</em> Respondents can become frustrated if a questionnaire goes on and on. It helps for respondents to feel a sense of progress. In the case of printed questionnaires, respondents can see how many pages/questions remain. With web-based surveys, it is helpful to include an indicator of progress. This might be expressed in words (e.g. “Page 3 of 6”) or as a horizontal bar-graph showing how much has been completed and how much remains. In the case of live or telephone surveys, this may be expressed verbally by the interviewer: E.g. “Just four more questions to go …”</p></li>
<li><p><em>Leave difficult questions toward the end.</em> Respondents are more likely to complete a survey if the difficult questions are posed at a time when they feel the questionnaire is nearly complete.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Avoid leading questions.</em> Formulate questions in a neutral way that doesn’t favor particular answers.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Pretest and pilot the questionnaire.</em> First, pretest the questionnaire by soliciting feedback from friends and colleagues. Ask them what they think the purpose is? This will help alert you to any unwanted demand characteristics. Note that demand characteristics can cause problems, even for exploratory and descriptive studies that aren’t motivated by an <em>a priori</em> hypothesis. After soliciting this initial feedback, <em>pilot</em> the questionnaire using a small subset of the intended population. This will help you identify possible problems before distributing the questionnaire to the entire sample of interest.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Closed and open questions.</em> Closed questions provide a limited set of response options whereas open questions invite narrative comments. Closed questions are easier to code and analyze, but they reduce the possibilities for more nuanced answers. Open questions invite new and unanticipated information. Open questions are especially appropriate in reconnaissance, exploratory, and descriptive studies.</p>
<p>Respondents tend to prefer closed questions since they are (typically) faster to respond to. However, if closed questions are poorly formulated, respondents are likely to be confused about how to answer (see below). When a participant is stumped by a closed question they are likely to wonder about the purpose of the questionnaire; some understanding of the purpose will help them resolve how to answer the question. Notice, however, that this sort of thinking will encourage demand characteristics. In short, when closed questions are confusing, they tend to increase demand characteristics.</p>
<p>A useful way of reducing confusion about closed questions is to offer an “Other” response, with an opportunity for the respondent to provide further explanation. E.g.</p>
<p>▢ Option #1 ▢ Option #2 ▢ Other (please explain:) ______________________________</p></li>
<li><p><em>Scrutinize each question.</em> After assembling a questionnaire, get in the habit of “question scrutinizing.” For each question provide a written answer to the following questions: “1. Who would have trouble answering this question?” In the case of closed questions, also ask: “2. For whom would <em>all</em> of the choices be inappropriate?” For example, you may have a question about marital status with two choices: <em>married</em> or <em>single.</em> Ask yourself “Who would have trouble with this question?” Suppose a person was technically married, but had lived as a single person for the past decade. How should they answer this question? You might consider adding a third category: <em>married</em>, <em>single,</em> or <em>divorced/separated</em> Once again, ask yourself the question:Wwho would have trouble answering this question? For example, a divorced-and-remarried person might wonder whether to answer divorced/separated or married.</p>
<p>After scrutinizing each question, you may nevertheless decide to keep the question as it is. For example, you may conclude that although the question has some ambiguity, a less ambiguous form would be too complicated. Nevertheless, question-scrutinizing is a useful exercise in alerting you to possible problems. Writing down your answers is important because this task will slow you down and help you think carefully about each question.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Use ordinary language.</em> Avoid fancy vocabulary and complex grammar. Aim for an everyday conversational style. Try to avoid questions that make especially refined distinctions: these may be confusing for many respondents.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Avoid answer inertia.</em> Respondents often exhibit “answer inertia” in which they tend to answer “yes” to every question or “no” to every question. For example, an impatient respondent may simply feel in a <em>“no” mood</em>. In order to avoid this, modify the questions so that most respondents are likely to answer with a mixture of affirmative and negative responses. Mixing questions in this way will also tend to reduce <em>acquiescence bias</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Use converging multiple questions for important measures.</em> For important measures, aim to include several slightly different operationalizations that ultimately produce converging results.</p>
<p>Suppose, for example, that a researcher wants a measure of <em>the degree of musical interest</em> for each respondent. One question might be:</p>
<p>Identify the phrase that best describes your level of musical enjoyment: ▢ experience relatively little enjoyment from music ▢ find music mildly enjoyable ▢ get quite a bit of enjoyment from music ▢ am a music lover ▢ am a passionate music nut</p>
<p>A later question might address the level of musical interest differently:</p>
<p>Compared with most people, how would you compare your musical interest? ▢ I am much less interested in music than most people. ▢ I am a little less interested in music than most people. ▢ I have about the same interest in music as most people. ▢ I am a little more interested in music than most people. ▢ I am much more interested in music than most people.</p>
<p>Yet another question might address the level of musical interest using a different approach:</p>
<p>How important is music? ▢ music is absolutely essential ▢ music is important, but not essential ▢ music is one of the many good things in life ▢ music is over-rated</p>
<p>The three questions address slightly different things. The first question relates to musical <em>enjoyment</em>; the second question relates to musical <em>interest</em>; and the third question relates to the <em>importance</em> of music. Notice that a person might cogently respond by claiming to find music intensely enjoyable (“a passionate music nut”), have only moderate interest in music (“I have about the same interest in music as most people”), and regard music as ultimately unimportant (“music is over-rated”). This is a theoretically tenable view. Nevertheless, we would predict that the answers to these three questions will tend to correlate: someone who regards him/herself as a music lover, will be more likely to believe he/she enjoy music more than most, and to believe that music is relatively important. Conversely, someone who regards him/herself as having little interest in music, is also apt to believe that he/she is less interested in music than most people and that music is over-rated in importance.</p>
<p>As with all operationalizations, the researcher has not captured the essence of the intended theoretical term. All are approximations of the true concept. In the analysis, we would check to see that the various operationalizations correlate positively. If so, we might then combine the results from the pertinent questions into a single measure that we hope captures well the theoretical concept of interest.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Avoid conceptually mixed labels.</em> Do not label response scale using different concepts for the endpoints. In general, avoid inexact <em>antonyms</em>. The following are bad uses:</p>
<table class="table">
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Bitter</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>◉</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">◉</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">◉</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">◉</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">◉</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Sweet</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Sad</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">◉</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">◉</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">◉</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">◉</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">◉</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Happy</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><em>Sweet</em> is not the opposite the <em>bitter</em>: we can have experiences that are simultaneously bitter and sweet. Similarly, <em>happy</em> is not the opposite of <em>sad</em>. A person may be unhappy (as, for example, when feeling angry), but that doesn’t mean the person feels sad. In music, it is not entirely clear that <em>consonant</em> is the opposite of <em>dissonant</em>. It is much safer to label bipolar scales with a single term, modified by negatives—such as <em>un-, dis-, no, low</em> or <em>less</em> or amplifier —<em>more, greater, increasing</em>. For example:</p>
<table class="table">
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Happy</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">◉</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">◉</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">◉</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">◉</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">◉</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Unhappy</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Less Dissonant</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">◉</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">◉</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">◉</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">◉</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">◉</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>More Dissonant</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>No Syncopation</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">◉</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">◉</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">◉</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">◉</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">◉</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Highly Syncopated</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Some bipolar terms may be okay if they are especially clear, such as dark/light (rather than more-dark/less-dark), and warm/cool (rather than cool/less cool).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Labelled and unlabelled scales.</em> Suppose that our question asks “How often do you listen to music?” Compare the following response modes: ————– ————– ————– ————– ————– <strong>always</strong> frequently sometimes rarely never</p>
<p><strong>always</strong> ◉ ◉ ◉ never ————– ————– ————– ————– ————–</p>
<p>In statistical terms, the first scale is clearly <em>ordinal</em>: we can’t say that the difference between “always” and “frequently” is the same as the difference between “sometimes” and “rarely.” However, the second scale may be arguably treated as an <em>interval</em> scale. In short, the second scale is likely to provide more statistical power.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Odd and Even Response Categories.</em> For most questions involving a rating scale, an <em>odd</em> number of response categories is preferred since this allows the respondent to select a middle or neutral response. This is the reason why most response scales involve 3, 5, or 7 positions:</p>
<table class="table">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 19%">
<col style="width: 19%">
<col style="width: 19%">
<col style="width: 19%">
<col style="width: 19%">
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>always</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">◉</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">◉</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">◉</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">never</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>There are times, however, when the researcher would prefer to force the respondent not to sit on the fence. A good example is found in political polling. A given voter may be genuinely conflicted about which candidate to vote for. However, if this person votes, then they will ultimately be forced to make a choice. A political pollster will be interested in forcing the respondent not to sit of the fence. Using an even number of response points will force the respondent to tip his/her hand, and show which direction they are leaning:</p>
<table class="table">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 18%">
<col style="width: 15%">
<col style="width: 15%">
<col style="width: 15%">
<col style="width: 15%">
<col style="width: 16%">
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Prefer Democratic candidate</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">◉</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">◉</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">◉</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">◉</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Prefer Republican candidate</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></li>
<li><p><em>Order effects.</em> The order of questions can influence how people respond. Consider how changing the order of questions might lead respondents to think in different ways.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Partition Dependence.</em> In multiple-choice questions, the number of categories is known to influence how participants respond. Suppose, for example, that your survey asks musicians how long they practice each day. Consider two different versions, a 3-choice version:</p>
<p>▢ Less than 30 minutes per day ▢ Between 30 and 60 minutes ▢ Over 1 hour</p>
<p>… and a 5-choice version:</p>
<p>▢ Less than 30 minutes per day ▢ Between 30 and 60 minutes ▢ Between 1 and 2 hours ▢ Between 3 and 4 hours ▢ Over 4 hours</p>
<p>You might think that how you frame the question won’t change the answers. Surely, just as many people will choose the first and second choices whether you use the 3-choice version or the 5-choice version. However, research has established that increasing the number of choices changes the behavior of respondents. More people will select the first and second choices in the 3-choice version than in the 5-choice version (See, Fox &amp; Rottenstreich, 2006). That is, offering more choices will tend to spread out the responses, even when some of the categories are logically identical. This phenomenon is referred to as <em>partition dependence.</em> One way to reduce partition dependence is to ask respondents to provide their own number:</p>
<p>How long do you typically practice each day? ____________</p></li>
<li><p><em>Avoid Anchoring Effects.</em> People tend to be unduly influenced by any number or quantity they encounter. For example, participants in an experiment by Tversky and Kahneman observed a roulette wheel that stopped at either a low number (like 10) or a high number (like 65). They were then asked to guess the proportion of nations that are located in Africa. Those who had observed a high roulette number guessed almost twice the proportion of African nations compared with those who had observed a low roulette number. Many other experiments have demonstrated this anchoring effect. Mention a single number or range, and that will unduly influence participants responses.</p>
<p>Consider once again a survey that asks musicians how long they practice each day. If we ask: <em>How many hours per day do you practice?</em> we are apt to get longer responses than if we ask: <em>How many minutes per day do you practice?</em> In short, the “range” words ‘minutes’ and ‘hours’ act as anchors that will influence the responses.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Consider using more than one survey.</em> Rather than putting everything in a single survey, consider using multiple surveys. For example, a between-subjects design may prove better than a within-subjects design, especially in reducing possible demand characteristics. This can also be done with surveys by distributing different surveys to two or more groups of respondents. As in the case of other areas of research, it is often helpful to pursue an <em>explore-then-test</em> approach. An initial survey can be used to alert the researcher to particular relationships. Conjectures and hypotheses inspired by the first survey can then be explicitly tested in a second follow-up survey.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Solicit general comments.</em> It is typically the case that completion of a survey is voluntary. It is important to ask yourself why someone would have taken the time to fill-out your questionnaire. Some people are simply more altruistic and cooperative; they may complete a questionnaire out of feelings of good citizenship. Other people may have an axe to grind. They have their own agenda in completing the survey. They may be unhappy about the high prices for concert tickets, or want to encourage more music-making in the schools. It is helpful to include a “general comments” section at the end of the survey and to make it clear at the beginning of the survey that general comments will be invited at the end of the survey.</p>
<p>The inclusion of an open-ended “general comments” section serves three purposes. First, knowing that there is a general comments section may encourage a respondent to complete the survey—even if they regard the closed questions ill-conceived or irrelevant. Second, the general comments can alert you to unanticipated demand characteristics. Third, the general comments can be a source of ideas for further research.</p>
<p>Make sure you alert respondents at the beginning that general comments will be welcome at the end. For example, you might include the following statement in your instructions:</p>
<p>“This questionnaire consists of 20 questions, and will take an estimated 8 minutes to complete. General comments are invited at the end of the questionnaire.”</p></li>
<li><p><em>Use green for printed questionnaires.</em> Oddly, research has shown that people are more likely to respond to a questionnaire if the paper is green in color.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Craft an appropriate title.</em> Give your questionnaire a title that helps in recruiting participants from the target population, while avoiding creating demand characteristics that confound the intended purpose.</p></li>
