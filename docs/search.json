    "text": "Overview\nEmpirical methods in music research have been used to study aspects of musical style, performance practice, authorship, musical behaviors and auditory perception, among other topics. In this class, we will explore what it means to study music with the assistance of empirical methods, including philosophical debates that surround such approaches. Additionally, it will provide a foundation and overview of empirical methods used in musicological and music-theoretic research, equipping students with the tools needed to critically engage with the literature in the field, while designing their own empirically-based music research studies and engaging with the analysis of the data of musical behavior."

Disability information, including academic accommodations, is confidential under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.\n\n\nCOVID-19 Classroom Expectations\nStudents, faculty and staff must comply with University expectations regarding appropriate classroom behavior, including those outlined below and in the COVID-19 Expectations for Students. With respect to classroom procedures, this includes:\nPolicies regarding masking, social distancing and other public health measures evolve as the situation changes. Students are responsible for understanding and complying with current University, state and city requirements. In some classes, masking and/or social distancing may be required as a result of an Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) accommodation for the instructor or a student in the class even when not generally required on campus. In such cases, the instructor will notify the class.\nIf a student fails to comply with the COVID-19 Expectations for Students or other University expectations related to COVID-19, the instructor may ask the student to leave the class. The instructor is asked to report the incident to the Office of Community Standards for additional follow-up.\n\nIf you’re feeling sick…\nMaintaining the health of the community remains our priority. If you are experiencing any symptoms of COVID do not attend class. Follow the steps outlined on the NU sites for testing, isolation and reporting a positive case. Next, contact me as soon as possible to arrange to complete coursework.\nStudents who experience other personal emergencies should contact me as soon as possible to arrange to complete coursework.\nShould public health recommendations prevent in-person class from being held on a given day, I or the university will notify students.\n\n\n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nThis course strives to be an inclusive learning community, respecting those of differing backgrounds and beliefs.

Student Affairs has multiple resources to support student wellness and mental health. If you are feeling distressed or overwhelmed, please reach out for help. Students can access confidential resources through the Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), Religious and Spiritual Life (RSL) and the Center for Awareness, Response and Education (CARE). Additional information on all of the resources mentioned above can be found here:\nhttps://www.northwestern.edu/counseling/\nhttps://www.northwestern.edu/religious-life/\nhttps://www.northwestern.edu/care/\n\nHomework\nThere will be regular assignments in which you will be asked to respond to do one of the following:\n\nCritically engage with a study design\nAnalyze data (sometimes real, sometimes artificial)\nRespond to prompts about methodological dilemmas.\n\n\n\nMidterm Project\nThe midterm project will consist of a literature review and critical evaluation of a specific topic in the field of empirical musicology. You will discuss any methodological issues that might be present in the research questions at hand.\nAn example: We tend to exclude outliers when looking at data, but Debussy’s performances of his own pieces are statistical outliers when compared to other performances of his pieces. To what extent can we view performance data through such a lens, and how would you go about addressing the question?\n\n\nFinal Project\nThe final project will be focused on a research quetsion of your choosing, and will be broken up into several a peer-reviewed first draft, a presentation, and a final paper."
