A little faith, peace of mind, see what passes through.  
The sun will shine on you again, a bell will ring inside your head - and all
will be brand new.  
  
Come alive, come on in, here's something that you know.  
The world's as wide, as your life is thin, So entertain your goals.  
The sun will shine on you again, a bell will ring inside your head - and all
will be brand new.  
  
All will be brand new.  
  
I can tell you what you want to hear, I've been there once before.  
You pulled me through my empty nights, sleepless on your floor.  
The sun will shine on you again, a bell will ring inside your head - and all
will be brand new.  
  
And all will be brand new.  
And all will be brand new.

I'm a stranger to this place, where real life and dreams collide.  
And even though I fall from grace, I will keep the dream alive.  
I will keep the dream alive.  
  
Four Seasons, seconds, flicker, and flash, I'm alone.  
A lonely scream provides the scene - it's no hope.  
Every night I hear you scream, but you don't say what you mean.  
This was my dream, but now my dream has flown.  
  
I'm a stranger to this place, where real life and dreams collide.  
And even though I fall from grace, I will keep the dream alive.

Little by little you have to give it all in all your life  
And all the time I just ask myself why you're really here?  
  
True perfection has to be imperfect  
I know that that sounds foolish but it's true

I would like that  
To be rich and have a lot of fans  
And lots of girls to prove that I'm a man  
To be number one - and loved by everyone  
  
Getting drugged up with my trendy friends  
They really dig me, man, and I dig them  
And the money that I spend, it is like my fame, and it's quickly gone  
  
No more swimming in my guitar shaped pool  
No more reporters at my beck and call  
No more cocaine, now it's only ground chalk  
And I can't afford a taxi so I have to walk  
  
Didn't I have a nice time  
Wasn't it sucha nice time  
Didn't I have a nice time  
  
I realize I should have stuck to my guns  
You stood me out just like a bastard son  
And I lost myself, but I know that it was wrong  
And it cost me a lot  
  
No more drinking cause now the club shuts down  
And I'm out here on my arse with the rest of you clowns  
I get really scared without my bodyguard  
And I'm sitting all alone in my expensive yard  
  
Didn't I have a nice time  
Wasn't it such a nice time

There's air of silence  
In the bedroom and all around  
Touch me now  
I close my eyes and dream away  
  
It must have been love but it's over now  
It must have been good but I lost it somehow  
It must have been love but it's over now  
From the moment we touched 'til the time had run out  
  
Make-believing we're together  
That I'm sheltered by your heart  
But in and outside  
I've turned to water like a teardrop in your palm  
And it's a hard winter's day  
I dream away

It was all that I wanted  
Now I'm living without  
It must have been love but it's over now

One that I can no longer disguise  
While other snakes just she'd their skins  
Forked tongues pointing out my sins  
Even though I realise that history's not on my side  
Even though I realise the pioneer skin still curls up in my eyes  
  
If I don't go crazy, I'll lose my mind  
I saw a life before me but now I'm blind  
I wanna go to heaven, never been there before  
I wanna go to heaven, so you kill me some more  
  
Flying high upon the gallows  
Too messed up to step out of the shadows  
A drugged up heart that knows no sorrow  
Rescued from this deep dark hollow  
Stick on these boots and sharpen the nails  
Time is nigh for you leather girls  
Maybe we should end this race  
Vanish while we cannot leave no trace

I saw a life before me, but now I'm blind  
See one-arm film stars on alien beaches  
Potted gold and tattooed faces

Diazepam dreams there catching streams  
Paper dinosaurs flash blue and green  
Still I've got a flash-bulb head
