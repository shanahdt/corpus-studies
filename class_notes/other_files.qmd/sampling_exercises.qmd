## Sampling Approaches

For each case, identify the kind of sampling employed.

1.  A researcher walks into a music library with a question: *Are
    sharp keys more common than flat keys?* Wandering through the
    stacks, she blindly grabs volumes off the shelves and allows each
    volume to open spontaneously to some page. She takes note of the
    key signature.
    
    
2.  A professional music marketer is interested in carrying out a
    detailed survey of musical tastes in Britain. The marketer decides
    to use the ACORN geodemographic profile. British households will
    be sampled in proportion to the second-level ACORN categories:
    *wealthy executives* (8.6 percent of the population), *affluent
    greys* (7.7%), *flourishing families* (8.8%), *prosperous
    professionals* (2.2%), *educated urbanites* (4.6%), *aspiring
    singles* (3.9%), *starting out* (2.5%), *secured families*
    (15.5%), *settled surburbia* (6.0%), *prudent pensioners* (2.6%),
    *asian communities* (1.6%), *post-industrial families* (4.8%),
    *blue collar roots* (8.0%), *struggling families* (14.1%),
    *burdened singles* (4.5%), *high rise hardship* (1.6%), and *inner
    city adversity* (2.1%).
    
    
    
3.  A researcher is interested in assembling a random sample of
    "classical" keyboard music. She has determined that she needs
    roughly 20 pieces for her study. In order to maximize data
    independence, she wants each piece to be written by a different
    composer. Using Wikipedia, she finds an alphabetical list of
    "classical composers." For each letter of the alphabet, she
    selects the first composer who she knows has written for piano:
    Isaac Alb√©niz, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, Alfredo Casella, Claude
    Debussy, Edward Elgar, Manuel de Falla, etc.
    
    
    
4.  In piloting an experiment, a graduate student recruits her
    graduate student colleagues as experimental participants.
    
    
    
5.  A team of researchers is interested in emotional expression in
    Hindustani film music. Indian participants are asked to
    characterize the emotional tenor of various film scenes. Using the
    descriptions, the researchers then classify the scenes into 14
    categories --- such as *romantic, humorous, physical conflict,
    emotional tension,* etc. The researchers then select four scenes
    for each of the 14 categories and analyse the associated
    background music. Their goal is to identify musical features in
    Hindustani culture that signal *romance, humor,* etc.
    
    
    
6.  A medievalist thinks that the Dorian mode was more likely to have
    been heard as comparatively "happy" whereas the Phrygian mode was
    more likely to have been heard as comparative "sad" for medieval
    listeners. In order to test this notion, the scholar examines all
    of the *Glorias* (nominally "happy" text) and *Kyries* (nominally
    "sad" text) in the *Liber Usualis.* The prediction is that Dorian
    will predominate for *Glorias* while Phrygian will be more likely
    to occur for *Kyries.*
    
    
    
7.  A researcher is interested in changing harmonic patterns in the
    masses of Palestrina. The researcher makes us of the Humdrum
    database of the scores for the complete 103 masses assembled by
    musicologist John Miller.
    
    
    
8.  Paul von Hippel and David Huron (2000) carried out a study to test
    the idea that melodies tend to change direction following a leap,
    and that this pattern is ubiquitous in musical melodies around the
    world. In order to test this idea, they made use of two musical
    samples. The first sample selected music spanning five centuries.
    The second sample selected music spanning five continents: Africa,
    Asia, Europe, North and South America.
    
    
    
9.  Unsure of the contents of a box, an archivist reaches in and grabs a couple of documents, which he then examines.
    
    
    
10. A researcher wants to know whether there is anything Italian,
    French or German about augmented sixth chords. Using large
    computer databases, the researcher uses Humdrum to isolate 900
    sonorities in which the lowered sixth and raised fourth appear
    concurrently (including enharmonic spellings): 300 each written by Italian, French and German composers. Each of the sonorities is then classified as either Italian, French, German or Other.
