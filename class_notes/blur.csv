Everything was sinking  
Said snow would come on Sunday  
The old school was due and the traffic grew  
Upon the Westway  
Where I stood watching comets lonesome trails  
Shining up above me the jet fuel it fell  
Down to earth where the money always comes first  
And the sirens sing  
  
Bring us the day they switch off the machines  
'Cause men in yellow jackets putting adverts inside my dreams  
An automated song and the whole world gone  
Fallen under the spell of the distance between us when we communicate  
Still picking up shortwave  
Somewhere they're out in space  
It depends how you're wired when the night's on fire  
Under the Westway  
  
Now it's magic arrows hitting the bull  
Doing one eighty still standing at last call  
When the flags coming down  
And the Last Post sounds  
Just like a love song  
For the way I feel about you  
Paradise not lost it's in you  
On a permanent basis I apologize  
But I am going to sing  
  
Hallelujah  
Sing it out loud and sing it to you  
Am I lost out at sea  
'Til a tide wash me up off the Westway

My mind is gone, my mind is gone  
It seems so very little I can do  
  
Cause all these things I want to know

Tell me, tell me, tell me please [Repeat: x3]  
Won't you tell me please  
  
I'm so full of emptiness  
It's so hard to sustain the mess  
I've no idea who I am at all  
So tell me, tell me, tell me please  
What is this that hovers me  
Before I smash my head against the wall  
  
Cause all these things I want to know

There's a low in the high forties  
And Saturday's locked away on the pier  
Not fast enough dear  
And on the malin head, black pool looks blue and red  
And the queen, she's gone round the bend  
Jumped off land's end

In a pocket in a grey flannel suit  
Re tomorrow's cash today  
And check your pulse  
  
Waste metals crawling to the kerb  
And softs dropped in a summer term  
Sugars melted in the mouth  
Of a broken home  
If we knew a better option

And it could be long time before he thinks again
