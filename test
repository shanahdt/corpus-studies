I tried to keep the beat.
It went back and forth with a rhythm that I tried to memorize.
I enjoyed listening to it.It was easy to tap along to.
I liked the tempo.
It had an easy rhythm. Easy to tap along.
A little slower but still upbeat.  
It flowed very well.  Easy to get the rhythm.
Fun to tap along to.
It flowed nicely. More difficult to tap.
