### Sampling

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The goal of sampling is to be able to make accurate claims about
some "population" even though you have only examined a subset of
that population. Sampling is carried out only for practical reasons.
If researchers had infinite resources, we would only study entire
populations rather than samples. Some people believe that making
generalizations from small samples is inherently untenable. However,
statisticians have formally demonstrated that sampling can provide a
very effective way of making inferences about a much larger group.
This is also borne-out in practice: from a small sample of blood, a
medical technician can often infer a great deal about the health of
a patient. The technician doesn't need to take *all* of your blood
in order to make such inferences.

**Population:** everything (or everyone) that you're interested in.
A population is whatever you want it to be.

-   e.g. all the world's people
-   all the world's people including living and deceased
-   all Western-enculturated people
-   all people who enjoy listening to music
-   all clarinet players

A "population" does not refer only to people: Other examples:

-   all of the music written by Vivaldi
-   all solo flute music (both with and without accompaniment)
-   all music in the minor mode
-   all of the jazz scores available in the New York Public Library
-   all performances of Rachmaninov's 2nd piano concerto
-   all recordings of Rachmaninov's 2nd piano concerto
-   all commercially released recordings of Rachmaninov's 2nd piano
    concerto
-   all the commercial recordings of Rachmaninov's 2nd piano
    concerto accessible via the web

**Sample:** a subset of the population that you hope closely
resembles the population as a whole.

A sample is said to be **representative** when the property of
interest is identical in both the sample and the population.

A sample is said to be **biased** when the property of interest
differs between the sample and the population.

#### Defining Your Population

You can't sample a population unless you have a clear idea of what
constitutes the population of interest. It often requires careful
thought to identify the appropriate population. Suppose, for
example, that you are a political pollster. Your aim is to predict
the likely election results for a national election in Denmark.
What, precisely, is the population you are interested in?

-   All Danish citizens?
-   All people living in Denmark?
-   All people living in Denmark eligible to vote?
-   All people eligible to vote in Danish elections?
-   All people likely to vote in Danish elections?
-   ...

**Sampling method:** the way you recruit or assemble your sample.
When your population consists of people, sampling methods might
include soliciting information by telephone (telephone sampling),
street sampling, mail sampling, web sampling, classroom sampling,
concert sampling, etc. You might hire a professional pollster to
carry out a sophisticated sampling method. (Pollsters know more
about sampling than any other group of professionals.)

**Sampling bias:** when the sampling method introduces differences
that cause the sample not to be representative. We try to avoid or
minimize sampling bias.

When conducting a telephone survey, a pollster may be tempted to ask
to speak to a respondent's spouse. However, spouses are likely to
share many things in common (such as political views) so the
sampling method will introduce a bias.

The only way to eliminate sampling bias is by sampling the entire
population. This is done sometimes (as in national census research).
It is also possible when the population is relative small. For
example, since Brahms published only three string quartets, it may
be possible to make fully accurate summary comments by examining all
three quartets. In most research however, it is not practical to
examine an entire population.

In street sampling, bias can be introduced because the pollster may
be attracted to approach certain people and not others. For example,
a pollster may be more likely to approach someone who is smiling.
This will potentially bias the sample toward "friendly" people.
Also, curious people may hang around hoping that the pollster will
ask them. This may also introduce bias. A common technique is to
count a certain number of passers-by. For example, after someone has
completed the survey, count ten passers-by before approaching the
next person you encounter.

The key to good sampling is to control for those forms of bias that
would obviously skew the results, and to be aware of the how your
sample might fail to be representative.

#### Sampling Methods

There are many sampling methods. Here we identify six common
methods.

1.  **Convenience Sampling.** A convenience sample simply takes
    advantage of whatever might be available. For example, a sample
    of organ music by Gabriel Faur√© might simply consist of all of
    the scores available in a music library. Similarly, we might
    stand on a street corner and ask whoever passes by to answer
    questions on a survey. In the OSU School of Music, we have a
    (convenience) subject pool consisting of all the students in
    second year aural skills courses. The School of Music's subject
    pool represents Convenience samples are nearly always biased in
    some way, but they are easy to assemble.

    It is sometimes helpful to collect additional information
    regarding convenience samples in order to help identify ways
    that the sample is biased. For example, in the case of the OSU
    School of Music subject pool, we have collected basic
    demographic and other information from this pool to help us
    understand how this group of people differs from the general
    population.

2.  **Simple Random Sampling.** Suppose we want to know about
    musical instrument sales in the City of Nashville. We could use
    the telephone directory (www.yellowpages.com) to identify all of
    the shops within the city boundaries that sell musical
    instruments. Perhaps we discover that there are 131 retailers.
    From this list, we might randomly select 25 retailers in order
    to carry out our survey.

    Random sampling might be done by selecting slips of paper from a
    bowl, rolling dice, using a printed random number table (often
    provided in an Appendix of a book on statistics), or using a
    computer-programmed random generator.

    Suppose we have a video recording of an audience listening to a
    concert. Our hypothesis is that members of the audience "figet"
    more when listening to Schoenberg compared with Ravel. The video
    camera allows us to see 150 audience members and the recording
    lasts 40 minutes. Counting the figets for each audience member
    over the entire recording would require too much work. To
    simplify the problem, we might randomly select 25 of the 150
    audience members. In addition, instead of coding data for the
    entire video, we might count the number of figets during twenty
    randomly selected 10-second segments: ten 10-second segments
    from the Schoenberg work and ten 10-second segments from the
    Ravel. Here we are randomly sampling from the total visible
    audience, and also randomly sampling from the total length of
    the video recording.

3.  **Systematic Sampling.** A common alternative to simple random
    sampling is to employ a systematic sample. For example, in a
    study involving score-based analysis, we might sample every 50th
    measure. Similarly, we could sample CD recordings from a large
    library collection by using a ruler to select the CDs that occur
    every 25 cm.

    Suppose that we have a questionnaire we want to distribute to
    people who attended a concert. There might be 500 audience
    members, but we have only 50 surveys to distribute. One approach
    would be to distribute the questionnaires to the first 50 people
    leaving the concert hall. Notice, however, that this might bias
    our sample to people who are in a hurry, or people who didn't
    like the concert and are eager to leave. A better approach would
    be to hand-out our survey to every tenth person as they exit
    from the concert hall.

4.  **Stratified Sampling.** Many populations exhibit
    sub-populations. For example, in music, we can identify
    different styles, like pop, folk, jazz and classical. We can
    also identify different genres, like vocal, instrumental, and
    mixed (vocal+instrumental) music. Similarly, we might expect
    that music-related behaviors might differ for infants, children,
    adolescents, adults and elderly. When we have reason to suspect
    that difference in sub-populations might influence the results,
    it is common to sample in such a way to ensure that each of the
    main sub-populations are represented. In Post and Huron (2009)
    for example, we were interested in common-practice era tonal
    classical music. So we decided to use a stratified sample
    consisting of music from three periods: Baroque, Classical and
    Romantic. Our overall sample consisted of equivalent numbers of
    works from each of these historical eras.

5.  **Quota Sampling.** A type of stratified sampling in which
    sub-samples are weighted according to their prevalence in the
    population. For example, in the general population, 51% are
    female and 49% are male. So in our sampling, we might want to
    ensure that 51% of our sampled individuals are female. Suppose
    that we find that 52% of instrumentalists are most accomplished
    on guitar, 33% are most accomplished on keyboards, 12% on flute,
    9% on trumpet, 8% on violin, etc. In quota sampling, we would
    aim to sample the same proportions for each instrument. We might
    use a commerical music catalogue to determine the ratios of
    different types of music. For example, we might note that 60% of
    the entries in a catalogue are classified as "pop," 25% of the
    entries are deemed "rock," 10% jazz, and 5% classical. A quota
    sample would aim to duplicate these proportions.

    Collister and Huron (2008) were interested in the
    intelligibility of vocal lyrics. We collected a sample of 78,000
    words from lyrics. We found that 81% were monosyllabic, 16% were
    bisyllabic, and 2% were trisyllabic. In testing the
    intelligibility of individual words in a sung context, we
    employed the same proportions of monosyllabic, bisyllabic, and
    trisyllabic words.

6.  **Matched Random Sampling.** A way of linking members from two
    or more samples. For example, a study might involve matching
    each professional musician with an amateur musician who plays
    the same instrument. One might pair a randomly selected work in
    the major mode with a randomly selected work by the same
    composer in the minor mode.

    Sometimes, the matching is done within each participant. For
    example, we might compare the milk produced by each cow with the
    milk produced by the same cow after music is introduced to a
    dairy barn. When the results for a single individual are
    compared across conditions, this is also referred to as a
    "repeated measures" design.

#### Western Sampling Bias

Ethnomusicologists have rightly criticized music psychologists for
assuming that experiments done with Western-enculturated
participants necessarily apply to all the world's peoples. If
ethnomusicologists ran the psychology journals, every article would
begin with a warning analogous to those found on cigarette packages:

"The ideas expressed in this article are those of
Western-enculturated researchers who have studied only a handful
of Western-enculturated subjects, and who brazenly presume (though
they never explicitly state so) that the results of this study
somehow generalize to people in other cultures."

It is impractical to suppose that every musical study can be done
with participants drawn from all over the world. Research can be
done only if it is practical. It is reasonable to rely on
convenience samples for research, but it is not reasonable to assume
that a convenience sample is representative of the entire world. It
is important in any study to make a clear statement of the sample,
and to identify the limitations of any sample with regard to the
presumed population of interest.
