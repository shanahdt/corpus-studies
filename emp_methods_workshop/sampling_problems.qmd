[GROUP TASK #9:]{.small} Issues in Sampling

For each study, identify one or more issues that may potentially cause
the sample to be biased.

1.  An orchestra manager is eager to better understand the likes and
    dislikes of the orchestra's audience. She distibutes a survey to
    the first 50 people who arrive at the orchestra's gala December
    matinee concert.
    
    
    
    
    
2.  A researcher is interested in which local radio stations are most
    listened to by people when driving. The researcher makes a deal
    with ten local garages. Whenever a car is brought into the shop,
    the mechanic first turns on the car radio and records the station
    to which the radio is tuned. After a month of collecting data, the
    researcher has over two thousand observations.
    
    
    
    
    
3.  A researcher is interested in voice-leading practices. He encodes
    the complete fugues from the Bach *Well-Tempered Clavier* and
    writes software to test various hypotheses in the musical
    organization.
    
    
    
    
    
4.  A researcher wants to sample opinions from people attending a
    nightclub. The quietest places in the club to conduct verbal
    interviews are the restrooms. Two male and two female research
    assistants are stationed inside the restrooms where they approach
    everyone who is about to leave the restroom to answer a couple of
    quick questions.
    
    
    
    
    
5.  Felix Mendelssohn wrote thousands of letters over the course of
    his life. A historical musicologist conjectures that Mendelssohn
    became increasingly religious towards the end of his life. From a
    complete list of letters, the researcher randomly selects 200.
    Each letter is read by the researcher and coded (yes/no) for
    whether it contains any spiritual, biblical or religious allusion
    or content.
    
    
    
    
    
6.  A researcher is interested in learning how much musicians earn and
    their various sources of income. The researcher succeeds in
    getting the e-mail list for all of the members of the American
    Federation of Musicians who have provided the AFM with an e-mail
    contact. An e-mail is sent to members soliciting participation.
    The e-mail contains a link to the survey's website.
    
    
    
    
    
7.  In the early 1980s, Christa Hansen was eager to test whether
    non-Westerners also show evidence of statistical learning for
    pitch relationships. Her aim was to recruit listeners who were not
    familiar with Western musical culture. Along with her husband,
    Putra, Hansen set out on a small motorcycle toward the remote
    northeastern region of the island of Bali. Whenever they met
    someone they asked two questions: "What is the most isolated
    village in this area? And does it have a gamelan?" Having reached
    this village, they again asked the same questions, and so
    continued on their quest. When they were no longer able to use
    their motorcycle, a footpath took them to a remote village in the
    shadow of the Gunung Agung volcano. Hansen concluded that she had
    reached a truly isolated place when the villagers surmised that
    this fair-skinned stranger must be Javanese. Recruiting
    twenty-seven participants from this village, Hansen was able to
    collect data for her experiment.
    
    
    
    
    
8.  Sandra Trehub and her colleagues regularly carry out musical
    studies with newborn infants. From local-area hospitals, they are
    able to get contact information with names and telephone numbers
    of mothers who have recently given birth in the various hospitals.
    They recruit participants by phoning the mothers, describing the
    basic aims of their experiments, and asking whether they would be
    willing to participate in an experiment with their new infant. A
    small sum (roughly $20) is paid to volunteers. Since the research
    lab is located in a suburban area, there is ample parking. There
    is also reasonable bus service.
