[GROUP TASK #17:]{.small} The Key of Funeral Marches

#### Answer

Volume 17 of the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians
identifies seven classic funeral marches. As it turns out 5 of those
7 marches are in the key of F minor. Test the hypothesis that
funeral marches tend to be composed in the key of F minor.

In order to calculate chi-square, we need to determine the
probability of any given musical work being written in F minor.

The following table shows a distribution of keys from a convenience
sample of 3,121 works from the common practice Western art music
tradition.

  ------------- ----------- -----------
  **Tonic**     **Major**   **Minor**
  C             358         6
  C#            2           2
  D             194         96
  D#            0           2
  Eb            125         0
  E             24          35
  F             757         10
  F#            2           4
  G             978         119
  G#            0           2
  Ab            11          0
  A             126         61
  Bb            198         2
  B             2           5
  **Totals:**   2,777       344
  ------------- ----------- -----------

Notice that works in F minor account for just 0.32 percent of all
works in the sample (10/3121). However, the sample includes both
major- and minor-key works. As a proportion of *minor*-key works,
works in F minor account for 2.9 percent of all works (10/344). As
it stands, our hypothesis is perhaps poorly defined. One might
reasonably argue that funeral marches would naturally all be written
in the minor mode. So it seems unfair to include major key works in
our calculation of what would be the "expected" distribution. A more
conservative statistical test would limit our comparison to the
distribution of works in minor keys. If we ignore the major mode,
then the probability of a given *minor-mode work* being in F minor
is 2.9 percent (i.e., 10/344). Therefore, for a sample of 7 works,
we would normally expect 7 Ã— 10/344 works in F minor. That is, we
would expect 0.203489 of a piece.

Another question arises regarding the number of categories.
Excluding the major keys, there are 14 categories in the above
table, representing 14 possible minor-mode keys. Actually, since
there were no instances of minor-mode works in A-flat minor, we
might exclude that, reducing the number of minor-mode keys to 13.
But are there 13 categories in our test? The hypothesis focuses
specifically on F minor. So a better way to think of the data is
between two categories: either in F minor, or in some other minor
key. Accordingly, our chi-square test will be limited to two
categories.

Is the tendency to write funeral marches in F minor statistically
significant at the 0.01 level?

Once again, for a sample of 7 minor-key works, we would expect
0.2035 (2.9% of 7) works to be in the key of F minor.

Our chi-square value is 113.05. With one degree of freedom, at the
99% confidence level, the critical value of chi-square is 6.635.
Since our calculated chi-square value exceeds the critical value, we
can discard the null hypothesis, and accept that the results are
consistent with the hypothesis. The results are statistical
significant at p<0.01. The data are therefore consistent with the
hypothesis that funeral marches tend to be written in the key of F
minor.

Actually, our chi-square value is so big, that it would still have
been statistically significant even if we had chosen the 99.99%
confidence level.
