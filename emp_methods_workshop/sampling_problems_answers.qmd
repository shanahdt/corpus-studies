[GROUP TASK #9:]{.small} Issues in Sampling - DISCUSSION

For each study, identify one or more issues that may potentially cause
the sample to be biased.

1.  An orchestra manager is eager to better understand the likes and
    dislikes of the orchestra's audience. She distibutes a survey to
    the first 50 people who arrive at the orchestra's gala December
    matinee concert.

    The first people to arrive are likely to differ in several ways
    from people who arrive later. For example, early arrivals might
    be especially eager, or especially social, or may come early
    because they take the bus (perhaps less affluent), etc.
    
    (1) It would be better to distribute survey randomly (using a
    systematic method like every 10 people).
    
    In addition, the survey is distributed at only one concert. As a
    matinee (afternoon) concert, it may attract a different
    clientele. Also, concerts in December (during the holiday
    season) may tend to attract a different audience than concerts
    during the rest of the year.
    
    (2) Better to sample more than one concert.

2.  A researcher is interested in which local radio stations are most
    listened to by people when driving. The researcher makes a deal
    with ten local garages. Whenever a car is brought into the shop,
    the mechanic first turns on the car radio and records the station
    to which the radio is tuned. After a month of collecting data, the
    researcher has over two thousand observations.

    In general, this is a pretty good sampling method.
    (1) The sample may be biased toward older cars (that require
    repairs), and/or toward new cars under warrantee.
    (2) We have no idea whether a given motorist spends little or
    lots of time listening to the radio.
    (3) The sample may be biased towards white-collar workers and
    women; blue-collar workers and men are perhaps more likely to do
    their own repairs. N.B. If the researcher were to ask the
    participating garages to keep track of the sex of their clients,
    then the research can compensate for paucity of males. Standing
    on (several) street corners, the research could estimate the
    proportion of male-to-female drivers, and so weight the garage
    results (quota sampling) by sex.
    
    Notice that it would be bad to use car rental agencies for this
    sampling method.

3.  A researcher is interested in voice-leading practices. He encodes
    the complete fugues from the Bach *Well-Tempered Clavier* and
    writes software to test various hypotheses in the musical
    organization.

    (1) Biased towards Bach.
    (2) Biased towards Baroque practice.
    (3) Biased towards fugal practice.
    (4) Biased towards voice-leading in keyboard works.

4.  A researcher wants to sample opinions from people attending a
    nightclub. The quietest places in the club to conduct verbal
    interviews are the restrooms. Two male and two female research
    assistants are stationed inside the restrooms where they approach
    everyone who is about to leave the restroom to answer a couple of
    quick questions.

    (1) The sample may be biased towards those individuals who are
    drinking (since they are more likely to visit the restroom).
    (2) The sample may be biased against those individuals who spend
    only a little time in the discotheque ("club-hopping"), since
    they are less likely to visit the restroom.
    (3) The sample may be biased towards those individuals who are
    cooperative/conscientious.
    (4) The sample may be biased towards those individuals who are
    dating a person of the opposite sex (since that person is
    elsewhere).
    (5) There is a slight danger or reinterviewing the same
    individual.
    (6) Depending on the goal, the researcher might want to sample
    from more than one discotheque.
    Otherwise, the sampling method looks good. Over several hours,
    there is a good chance that the researchers will interview the
    majority of patrons.

5.  Felix Mendelssohn wrote thousands of letters over the course of
    his life. A historical musicologist conjectures that Mendelssohn
    became increasingly religious towards the end of his life. From a
    complete list of letters, the researcher randomly selects 200.
    Each letter is read by the researcher and coded (yes/no) for
    whether it contains any spiritual, biblical or religious allusion
    or content.

    (1) Better to use a quota sample in which equal numbers of
    letters are selected from each decade of life.
    (2) Might also want to control for the *length* of the letters,
    since longer letters are more likely (by chance) to contain
    spiritual, biblical or religious content.

6.  A researcher is interested in learning how much musicians earn and
    their various sources of income. The researcher succeeds in
    getting the e-mail list for all of the members of the American
    Federation of Musicians who have provided the AFM with an e-mail
    contact. An e-mail is sent to members soliciting participation.
    The e-mail contains a link to the survey's website.

    (1) Biased towards those musicians with an e-mail account.
    (2) Biased towards those musicians who are willing to divulge
    their e-mail account.
    (3) Biased towards those who are cooperative/conscientious and
    will complete the survey. (Biased towards those who have time on
    their hands.)
    (4) Biased towards American and Canadian musicians (AFM serves
    both countries).
    (5) Biased towards unionized (rather than ununionized)
    musicians.
    (6) Biased towards performers (rather than composers,
    conductors, teachers) etc.

7.  In the early 1980s, Christa Hansen was eager to test whether
    non-Westerners also show evidence of statistical learning for
    pitch relationships. Her aim was to recruit listeners who were not
    familiar with Western musical culture. Along with her husband,
    Putra, Hansen set out on a small motorcycle toward the remote
    northeastern region of the island of Bali. Whenever they met
    someone they asked two questions: "What is the most isolated
    village in this area? And does it have a gamelan?" Having reached
    this village, they again asked the same questions, and so
    continued on their quest. When they were no longer able to use
    their motorcycle, a footpath took them to a remote village in the
    shadow of the Gunung Agung volcano. Hansen concluded that she had
    reached a truly isolated place when the villagers surmised that
    this fair-skinned stranger must be Javanese. Recruiting
    twenty-seven participants from this village, Hansen was able to
    collect data for her experiment.

    A superb sampling approach. Just two problems.
    (1) All of her participants were from the same village, so the
    data aren't entirely independent from each other. (A few people
    from several different villages would have been better ---
    although more difficult.)
    (2) She collected data from only a single culture, so the
    conclusions must be described regarding people from the Gunung
    Agung region.

8.  Sandra Trehub and her colleagues regularly carry out musical
    studies with newborn infants. From local-area hospitals, they are
    able to get contact information with names and telephone numbers
    of mothers who have recently given birth in the various hospitals.
    They recruit participants by phoning the mothers, describing the
    basic aims of their experiments, and asking whether they would be
    willing to participate in an experiment with their new infant. A
    small sum (roughly $20) is paid to volunteers. Since the research
    lab is located in a suburban area, there is ample parking. There
    is also reasonable bus service.

    In general, a pretty good sampling method. Biases:
    (1) Western (Canadian) moms.
    (2) Biased towards stay-at-home moms with cars.
    (3) Biased towards cooperative/conscientious mothers.
