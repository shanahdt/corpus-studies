An example of a descriptive empirical study in music is an article by
Huron (1989) which measured how many polyphonic lines listeners can
track simultaneously. Listeners heard polyphonic organ music by J.S.
Bach and continuously identified the number of concurrent musical parts.
Huron measured the error rates and found that musician listeners were
reasonably accurate for 1-, 2-, and 3-voice textures. But when the music
contained 4 or more musical parts, listeners made many more errors.

An example of a correlational study is an article by Huron and Ommen
(2007) on syncopation in American popular music. We simply selected
recordings from the period 1890 to 1939 and counted how often
syncopations occur. The study began with no hypothesis to test (although
later we did use the collected data to test two hypotheses).

More commonly, models are rendered as computer programs. Later, we will
examine a computer model of a B-flat valve trumpet/performer interaction
(Huron & Berec, 2009).
