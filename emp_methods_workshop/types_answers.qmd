[GROUP TASK #4:]{.small} Types of Empirical Studies - [ANSWERS /
DISCUSSION]{.small}

Identify whether the following studies are best regarded as
*reconnaissance, descriptive, measurement, correlational,* or
*experimental*. If *correlational* or *experimental*, further indicate
whether it is *exploratory correlational* or *exploratory
experimental*.

1.  A researcher publishes an article describing a newly discovered
    box containing composition sketches written by Bart√≥k.

    The description suggests that no explanatory theory is offered.
    No hypothesis is proposed. No manipulation is carried out. The
    description suggests that no measurements or counts are
    reported. So the best answer would be that it is an
    *reconnaissance* study.

2.  While a musician takes a break, an ethnomusicologist clandestinely
    mistunes one of the strings on the instrument by 1/3 of a
    semitone. The ethnomusicologist suspects that the musician will
    notice the mistuning and so retune the instrument.

    Notice that the final sentence is very close to "The
    ethnomusicologist predicts that ..." Even if it is not stated,
    there is a clear test going on: if the musician recognizes the
    pitch change, then he/she is likely to retune the instrument.
    Notice that the ethnomusicologist has made a *manipulation* by
    mis-tuning the instrument. Consequently, the study is best
    regarded as an *experiment.*

3.  A researcher at *Billboard* magazine assembles and publishes music
    sales by genre for 85 countries.

    No prediction or test is reported. However, numbers (counts) are
    reported. This suggests that the best characterization is as an
    *measurement* study.

4.  A researcher analyses facial expressions in commercial videos of
    concert pianists. It is found that pianists tend to raise their
    eyebrows when the music is high in overall pitch.

    In this case the researcher is relating two measures --- the
    eyebrow placement and the average musical pitch. This is some
    sort of *correlational* study. It appears that there was no *a
    priori* hypothesis related to this finding. Consequently, it is
    perhaps best characterized as an *exploratory correlational
    study* rather than a *correlational study*.

5.  A researcher commissions ten composers to create "happy" and "sad"
    melodies. The researcher predicts that the happy melodies will
    exhibit larger melodic intervals than the sad melodies.

    The researcher has made a prediction. At the same time, the
    researcher has "manipulated" the world, by asking composers to
    create two melodies: a "happy" melody and a "sad" melody. The
    hypothesis is that happy melodies will involve larger melodic
    interval sizes. This makes the study a bone fide *experiment.*

6.  The manager of an orchestra is interested in identifying which
    repertoire attracts bigger audiences. She gathers audience
    statistics for a number of concerts from several orchestras. She
    classifies each program according to whether the music is
    predominantly Baroque, predominantly Classical, predominantly
    Romantic, predominantly Modern, or predominantly Pops. She finds
    that the largest audiences occur for Pops concerts.

    There is no hypothesis in this study. The researcher does not
    manipulate the world. She classifies the concerts and relates
    (correlates) these to measurements of audience size. The study
    is best described as *exploratory correlational.*

7.  A researcher interviews twenty young mothers about singing to
    their newborn infants. He finds most mothers report singing to
    their babies, but that they are more likely to sing when no other
    adult is observing them. The researcher concludes that many young
    mothers are self-conscious about their own singing and prefer not
    to have an audience other than their baby.

    No hypothesis reported, and no measurements are made. An
    interpretation is made to account for the reluctance of mothers
    to sing in the presence of other adults. The study is best
    described as *descriptive.*

8.  A researcher is interested in the phenomenon of globalization and
    collects data from different islands in the Kingdom of Tonga. For
    each island, she counts the number of Internet-connected
    computers, and also interviews people in order to determine their
    favorite music. She predicts that islands where people most prefer
    Western pop music will be the islands that are most
    Internet-connected.

    There is a hypothesis here, but no manipulation. So it is a
    *correlational* study.

9.  A school board is interested in the effect of introducing
    non-Western music into the middle school band program. Of eight
    middle schools in the district, four randomly selected middle
    schools include non-Western works in the band repertoire. At the
    end of the year, a sample of music students are interviewed from
    all eight schools in order collect feedback.

    The research involves a manipulation that changes things.
    However, there is no explicit *a priori* hypothesis, and the
    interviews seem rather informal in structure. It is probably
    best to characterize this study as an *exploratory experimental*
    study.

10. A music theorist carries out analyses of most of the serial works
    by Schoenberg, Webern and Berg. After analyzing the works, the
    theorist publishes a general article comparing and contrasting the
    serial techniques of the three composers. In particular, the
    theorist observes that, compared with the other composers, Webern
    is more likely to compose works structured as extended palindromes
    --- with the material in the second half of the work inverted.

    There is no *a priori* hypothesis. Although the analysis is
    formal, there are no explicit measurements made. This suggests
    that the study is not a *measurement study*. An interpretation
    of the music is offered, so it is probably best to classify the
    study as *descriptive*.
