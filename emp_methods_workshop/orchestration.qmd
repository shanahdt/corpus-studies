### Cluster Analysis in Orchestration

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cluster analysis is a form of statistical data analysis in which
subsets (called "clusters") are formed according to some notion of
similarity. There are many different variants of cluster analysis, but
most are hierarchical --- in which low-level clusters are successively
joined together to make larger clusters, and so on, until everything
is clustered into one large group. The result is a cluster tree or
*dendrogram*.

Randolph Johnson (2007) used cluster analysis to try to determine how
instruments are grouped together in orchestral works. He examined a
large number of scores from 19th century orchestral music. In order to
circumvent possible experimenter bias, Johnson used David Dubal's *The
Essential Canon of Classical Music* (2001) as his source for sampling
"orchestral music." For each work in Dubal's book, Johnson sampled
just a single random vertical sonority --- a single sounding moment.
He coded which instruments were playing at that moment. For example,
for a given moment in some score, the first and second violins might
be active, along with the violas, 'cellos and a solo clarinet. Johnson
ended up with several hundred coded sonorities --- one sonority from
each work. In this way, he ensured a high degree of data independence.

Johnson then used cluster analysis to analyze the instrumental
combinations. The computer first grouped together those instruments
which most commonly appeared together. As can be seen in the
dendogram, the first clusters include (1) violin + viola, (2) double
bass + 'cello, (3) flute + clarinet, (4) bassoon + oboe.

The second group of clusters include (5) horn + trumpet, and (6) bass
clarinet + English horn/cor anglais. In addition, two of the earlier
groups group together: (7) the violin/viola + the bassoon/oboe. You
can see all of the groupings and hierarchical groupings in the tree
below.

Johnson found that there were three over-arching instrumental
groupings in 19th century orchestral music (identified in the
dendrogram by the solid vertical line). One group consists of the
violin, viola, 'cello, double bass, flute, oboe, clarinet and bassoon.
The second group consists of the horn, trumpet, trombone, tuba,
piccolo and timpani. The third group consists of the bass clarinet,
English horn, harp, cornet, and contrabasson.

Cluster analysis does not tell you the "meaning" or origin of the
groups. It simply tells you that there are statistical pertinent
natural groupings that arise depending on the way you define
similarity. In this case, Johnson proposed a musically plausible
interpretation of his three over-arching groups: the first group he
dubbed "Standard" instrumentation; the second group he dubbed "Power"
instrumentation; and the third group he dubbed "Color"
instrumentation. The results of his analysis are consistent with the
idea that 19th century orchestral composers conceived or deployed
instruments in terms of three broad categories: (1) core or *standard*
instruments consisting of the strings and woodwinds, (2) loud,
energetic or *power* instruments consisting of the brass, piccolo, and
timpani, and (3) novelty or *color* instruments such as the English
horn, cornet, and the harp. Notice that the color instruments further
cluster into two groups: (i) quieter color instruments such as the
English horn, bass clarinet and harp, and (ii) louder color
instruments such as the cornet and contrabassoon. Johnson calls his
resulting theory of orchestration, the *SPC theory* (for Standard,
Power and Color).
