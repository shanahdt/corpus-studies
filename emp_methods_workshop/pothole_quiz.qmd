*Circle and identify each of the methodological transgressions in the
following description.*

*N.B. Some events may be regarded as transgressing more than one
methodological principle.*

### Big People, Big Music

For a number of decades now, considerable controversy has surrounded
a well-known theory of melody developed by Dr. Hoch of the Music
Department at Poxford College. The theory relates people's heights
to music.

[]{#double-use data}

Dr. Hoch formed the theory while doing research in the Congo. Hoch
discovered that Pygmys sing melodies containing predominantly small
intervals, whereas Bantu's sing melodies containing much larger
intervals. In Hoch's first book, *Pitch Reduction in Congolese Pygmy
Melody*, Hoch noted "This is evidence for my new theory that
interval size is proportional to the heights of the people who make
the music." [[1](#1)]

[]{#discovery fallacy}

Hoch's arch rival, Dr. Klein, has noted that Hoch's theory is
suspect because the theory originates in the *Egyptian Book of the
Dead*, where an obscure verse is often translated: "Big people make
big music." [[2](#2)]

[]{#ad hominen argument}

Professor Ruse, one of Hoch's defenders, has countered that Dr.
Klein's own views are suspect since Klein has admitted to having
taken illegal drugs in the 1960s and holds a degree from Golly
College (which is not even rated by the Pricetown Review).
[[3](#3)]

[]{#research hoarding} []{#data neglect}

Klein notes that, if only Hoch and Ruse could see Klein's
as-yet-unpublished data from Belize, they would see the error of
their ways. [[4](#4)] Dr. Wise points out that considerable
pertinent data is available at the Smithsonian, if only Hoch and
Klein would care to examine it. [[5](#5)]

[]{#naturalist fallacy}

As might be expected, Hoch's theory has attracted considerable
popular attention. An editorial writer for the *Lower Arlington
Snob* has started a crusade:

"Given that the national anthem contains so many large leaps, it
is obvious that the [short] children in our kindergartens should
not be singing it." [[6](#6)]

[]{#third variable problem}

On the contrary, the OSU basketball Buckeyes coach has realized that
the correlation between large melodic intervals and size is the
perfect way to increase players' heights. This year, Swiss yodeling
has become a standard part of team practice. [[7](#7)]

[]{#cohort bias}

In order to resolve the question of whether yodeling causes
increased height, Dr. Dee Velop decided to compare the melodies sung
by people at different ages. Dr. Velop randomly sampled 900 people
--- 150 each at the ages of 2, 5, 8, 10, 16, and 25. Dr. Velop found
that it is indeed the case that the older (taller) people sing
melodies with wider intervals. However, many of the older
participants in the study noted that yodeling was especially popular
10 years ago. [[8](#8)]

[]{#control failure}

In Hoch's second book, *Swedish Swing*, Hoch reported on a
replication study carried out in Sweden (where people are typically
tall). Hoch found that the average interval size for Swedish
melodies was 240 cents --- which, he says, "only goes to prove my
point." [[9](#9)]

[]{#multiple tests} []{#post-hoc hypothesis}

The ever-suspicious Dr. Klein decided to study the Inuit of
Greenland (who are somewhat short). Klein didn't find that Inuit
melodies had smaller intervals compared with Bantus. Nor did Dr.
Klein find evidence in support of another 31 popular hypotheses
about melodic organization. But Klein did find a statistically
significant (p<0.05) result that Inuit melodies have slighly more
notes per phrase than for Bantu melodies. [[10](#10)] After
spending time carefully examining the data, Klein also thought there
was some evidence suggesting that Inuit singers take slightly longer
to inhale while singing. A formal test of this hypothesis using
Klein's existing data showed that indeed, on average, Inuit singers
took 15 milliseconds longer to inhale than Bantu singers and this
was significant at p<0.05. [[11](#11)] [[12](#12)]

Motivated by the controversy, Prof. Long carried out a 30-year
experiment in rural Bolivia. Dr. Long recruited 1,255 children in 28
orphanages. Each orphanage was randomly assigned to either a "small
interval" or "large interval" group. The children in the "small
interval" orphanages were taught folk melodies with predominantly
small intervals while children in the "large interval" orphanages
were taught folk melodies with predominantly large intervals.
Children had no access to radio or television. Keeping detailed
records of the children's heights, Dr. Long found that there was no
systematic difference in the rates of growth and no difference in
the absolute heights between the two groups.

[]{#ad-hoc hypothesis}

Dr. Hoch was naturally displeased by the study, and has suggested
that the reason why Dr. Long failed to find the effect was because
of possible differences in diets between the various orphanages.
Hoch pointed out that some of the orphanages in Long's study are
known to be located in mountainous areas where diets are less
nutritious. [[13](#13)]

[]{#instrument decay}

A more serious problem with Dr. Long's study was that mid-way
through the study, Bolivia changed to the metric system, so the
numerical records are an indecipherable mixture of inches and
centimeters. [[14](#14)]

[]{#anti-operationalizing problem}

Dr. Bliss has questioned the use of either inches or centimeters for
measuring height:

"We all know what height is, and it is only crudely related to
such reductionistic measures as "yards" or "meters"."

Given the origin of the theory in the *Egyptian Book of the Dead*,
Bliss thinks *cubits* would be a more appropriate (though not
infallible) measure of height. But Bliss thinks even this is
impossible since no one can be sure how long a *cubit* is.
[[15](#15)]

[]{#mortality problem}

One group that was pleased with Long's study was the orphanage
operators --- since the researchers brought funds to support the
children's education. This income was a welcome supplement to
selling the shorter orphans to the North Korean submarine program
and the taller orphans to OSU basketball Buckeyes. [[16](#16)]

[]{#positive results bias} []{#bottom-drawer effect}

The *Journal of Musicological Musings* decided not to publish Dr.
Long's study because the results didn't support any widely accepted
theory of melody. [[17](#17)] As it turns out, a number of other
scholars have independently produced negative results. But each of
these scholars has been reluctant to even submit the results of
their research. [[18](#18)]

[]{#head-in-the-sand syndrome} []{#confirmation bias}

Dr. Hoch thinks there is enough research already, and there is no
need for further testing of this well-established and obvious
theory. [[19](#19)] Hoch notes that Stravinsky once said of Ravel
"Il est trÃ©s petit, non?" --- and does anyone doubt that Stravinsky
uses wider intervals than Ravel? [[20](#20)]

[]{#ipse dixit} []{#universalist phobia}

Dr. Hoch has also noted that no less a musicologist than Sir Percy
Smart has stated that the matter is now resolved. [[21](#21)]
However, Prof. Bliss remains skeptical. Says Bliss, "It is pure
folley to expect such a simple theory to apply to all of the world's
cultures." [[22](#22)]

[]{#presumptive representation}

By contrast, Dr. Pomo has argued that this whole business is part of
an upper-class conspiracy to denigrate short people. Yodeling has
become an entrenched canon whereas chanting is now widely desparaged
as "music for little people." Paid programing on cable TV frequently
shows vertically-challenged people engaged in IQ-demeaning
activities while Gregorian chant plays in the background. Short
people find that everyone expects them to like "The Monks of Saint
Bede." [[23](#23)]

[]{#relativist fallacy}

Dr. Pomo says that no music is any better or worse than any other
music. "We all know that no theory can be conclusively shown to be
better than any other theory. It simply doesn't matter whether the
height/melodic-interval theory is true or false." [[24](#24)]
