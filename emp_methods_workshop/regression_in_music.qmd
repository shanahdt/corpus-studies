## Regression to the Mean in Music

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recall that encountering a tall person does not *cause* the next
person to be shorter. It is simply that most people tend to be of
average height.

For over 400 years, it has been frequently observed that large
melodic intervals tend to be followed by a change in melodic
direction. Statistical studies show that this is indeed the case.
The following folksong melody provides a typical example. In this
melody there are 13 melodic leaps---if a leap is defined as any
interval larger than a diatonic step. Of these 13 melodic leaps, 11
are followed by a change of direction, 1 leap continues in the same
direction, and 1 is followed by a repeat of the same pitch. This
example is consistent with the notion that melodic leaps are
followed by a change in direction. However, there are other
possibilities.

Suppose that a melody made use of just three pitches: A, B and C.
Notice that there is only one possible leap: between A and C. Notice
also that if we leap up to the C, the only possible continuations
are a unison repetition of the C, or descending to B or A.
Similarly, if we leap down to the A, the only possible continuations
are a unison repetition or an ascending contour. Simply due to the
constraints on range, melodic leaps will tend to be followed by a
change of direction.

If we expand our melodic range from three pitches to four pitches,
the effect is reduced, but there will be a tendency for leaps to be
followed by a change of direction. If most of the pitches in a
melody tend to be in the center of the tessitura, and if large leaps
have a tendency to take the melody to the extremes of the range,
then most leaps will tend to be followed by a change of direction.

We can now propose two competing theories regarding the melodic
contours following a leap. The *post-skip reversal* theory proposes
that melodic leaps tend to be followed by a change of direction. The
*regression-to-the-mean* theory proposes that there is a tendency
for melodies to stay in the central portion of the tessitura.

Notice that the *regression-to-the-mean* theory implies that melodic
behavior following a leap depends on whether the consequent pitch is
high, medium, or low in tessitura. By contrast, the *post-skip
reveral* theory makes the same prediction no matter where in the
tessitura the leap occurs.

Let's distinguish four possible types of melodic leaps. A
*median-departing* leap is a leap that begins above (or below) the
median pitch, and moves even further away from the median. A
*median-crossing* leap is a leap that begins above (or below) the
median pitch, and crosses over the median in the other direction. A
*median-landing* leap is a leap that land on the central or median
pitch itself. Finally, a *median-approaching* leap is a leap that
moves closer to the median, but both pitches are above (or below)
the median. These different types of leaps are schematically
illustrated below. The illustration pertains only to ascending
leaps, but the concepts apply to descending leaps as well.

Notice that *post-skip reversal* and *regression-to-the-mean* make
different predictions. Post-skip reversal predicts a change in
direction for intervals in all four conditions. However,
regression-to-the-mean makes different predictions depending on the
condition. In the case of *median-departing* and *median-crossing*
leaps, regression-to-the-mean predicts a change of direction (back
toward the median pitch). However, in the case of *median-landing*
leaps, regression-to-the-mean predicts that the subsequent direction
doesn't matter: a melodic contour is just as likely to continue in
the same direction or reverse direction. Finally, in the case of
*median-approaching* leaps, regression-to-the-mean predicts that
there will be a tendency for the melodic contour to continue in the
same direction---exactly contrary to the post-skip reversal theory.

So what do actual melodies do? The following graph represents data
from over 3,000 melodic leaps. As can be seen, for median-departing
leaps there is a clear tendency for melodies to continue with a
change of direction. Similarly, for median-crossing leaps, leaps
tend to be followed by a change of direction. These results are
consistent with both post-skip reversal and regression-to-the-mean.
In the case of median-landing leaps, reversing direction or
continuing in the same direction are equally likely---as predicted
by regression-to-the-mean. Finally, in the case of median
approaching leaps, it is more likely to melodies to continue in the
same direction---as predicted by regression-to-the-mean. After a
study by von Hippel and Huron (2000), further research published by
von Hippel (2000a, 2000b) confirmed that melodic organization is
consistent with regression-to-the-mean, and is not consistent with
post-skip reversal.
