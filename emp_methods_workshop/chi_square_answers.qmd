### [GROUP TASK #16:]{.small} Chi-Square Tests - ANSWERS

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a survey of orchestral works it was found that 70 percent include an
oboe as part of the orchestration. A music scholar finds that composer A
uses an oboe in only 10 of 22 orchestral works (just 45%). Is this a
statistically significant difference?

70 percent of 22 works is 15.4 works
30 percent of 22 works is 6.6 works

With one degree of freedom, at the 95% confidence level, the critical
value of chi-square is 3.84. Since our calculated chi-squared value
exceeds the critical value, we can declare that the results are not
consistent with the null hypothesis. Instead, the results are
consistent with the research hypothesis.

Our statistical test allows us to state the following conclusion: The
observations are consistent with the idea that, compared with other
composers, composer A is less likely to include an oboe in the
instrumentation of orchestral works.

A music scholar finds that a sample of Italian baroque music shows 51
works in major keys and 9 works in minor keys. In a diverse sample of
baroque music from many European countries (including Italy), 480 works
were found to be in major keys and 210 works in minor keys. Compared
with their European colleagues, did Italian baroque composers tend to
favor works in major keys?

210 (minor) + 480 (major) works = 690 works in total
210/690 = 30.4348 percent minor
480/690 = 69.5652 percent major
For a sample of 60 Italian baroque works, we would expect:
30.4348 percent of 60 = 18.2609 in the minor mode
69.5652 percent of 60 = 41.7391 in the major mode

With one degree of freedom, at the 95% confidence level, the critical
value of chi-square is 3.84. Since our calculated chi-square value
exceeds the critical value, we can discard the null hypothesis, and
accept that the results are consistent with the hypothesis. The
results are statistical significant at p<0.05.

Our statistical test allows us to state the following conclusion: The
observations are consistent with the idea that, compared with other
European baroque composers, Italian baroque composers tend to favor
works in major keys.

An ethnomusicologist finds that just 130 of 220 Xhosa listeners say they
prefer *bumbuju* rhythms to *nobuju* rhythms. In one Xhosa village
however, 15 of 19 people say they prefer bumbuju. Can we claim that the
members of this village differ significantly from other Xhosa in their
rhythmic preferences?

130/220 Xhosa prefer bumbuju = 59.0909 percent
220-130 = 90; 90/220 Xhosa prefer nobuju = 40.9091 percent
In the village, we would expect:
59.0909 % of 19 = 11.2273 to prefer bumbuju
40.9091 % of 19 = 7.77273 to prefer nobuju

With one degree of freedom, at the 95% confidence level, the critical
value of chi-square is 3.84. Since our calculated chi-square value
fails to reach the critical value, we cannot discard the null
hypothesis. The results are not consistent with the hypothesis.
