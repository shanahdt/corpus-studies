## Syncopation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recall that a *measurement* study involves no testing of a hypothesis.
It simply involves making and reporting some measurements. An example
of a measurement study is Huron & Ommen (2006) which looked at the
historical changes in syncopation in American popular music. The study
took advantage of newly released digital re-issues of early wax
cylinder recordings, as well as 78-RPM and 45-RPM recordings of
popular music from the early twentieth century. We limited our study
to the first 50 years of commercial recording---namely the period from
1890 to the beginning of World War II (1939). The recorded sample of
music included 437 musical works. For each work, we randomly selected
a single moment (a particular second on the time counter) and
transcribed the bar or measure in which the second appeared. From the
transcribed notation of the rhythm we determined whether any
syncopation was present, and if so, we categorized the type of
syncopation.

#### How We Measured Syncopation

In order to measure syncopation, we had to make an operational
definition. In metrically organized music, each moment can be regarded
as occupying a particular point in the metric hierarchy. The highest
point (labelled "1") might be defined as coinciding with the
downbeat. The second highest point ("2") coincides with the third
beat in 4/4 meter. Other points in the metric hierarchy can be
similarly labelled as shown in Figure 1.

**Figure 1**

*Numerical representation of the metrical hierarchy for 4/4 meter. The
value "1" designates the highest value in the hierarchy.*

Using these "metric hierarchy numbers" we can see an interesting
pattern emerge for syncopated moments. For example, in Figure 2a
(below), a syncopation occurs because the first note is tied to the
second note. With each syncopated event, a note onset occurs at a
relatively low metrical level (i.e., a higher number), and is
sustained through a moment in the metrical hierarchy that has a higher
metrical level (i.e., a lower number) and that does not manifest a
corresponding event onset. In other words, there is a kind of metrical
"hole" in the rhythm, which we dubbed a *lacuna*. The *lacuna* became
our operational definition of a syncopated moment.

*Examples of syncopation. As in Figure 1, numerical values represent
positions in the metrical hierarchy.*

#### What We Found

For each of our sampled musical moments, we counted the number of
lacunae, and categorized the type of lacunae pattern. The results of
our study are summarized in Figures 3 and 4.

**Figure 3**

*The average number of lacunae (our operationalization of
syncopations) per sampled passage. The graph is consistent with the
(post hoc) notion that the density of syncopation increased over five
decades.*

**Figure 4**

*The percentage of irregular syncopations by decade.*

There are two conclusions from this study. The first conclusion is
entirely expected---grandmother research: it appears that over the
50-year period, the amount of syncopation per unit of time nearly
doubled, from just over one syncopation to nearly two syncopations per
unit of time. The second conclusion was unexpected. The variety of
patterns of syncopations appears to peak in the 1910s. In other words,
musicians in the 1910s seemed to have tried all sorts of rhythmic
syncopations, and then reduced the variety in the 1920s and 1930s.
Until about 1920, there appears to have been an increase in both the
quantity and variety of syncopations; after 1920, the variety seems to
have dropped, but the density of syncopations continued to increase.

Now recall that empirical studies never prove anything. This is also
the case here. It could be that our sample of 437 recordings does not
adequately refect the music of the time. It could be that our random
sampling of musical moments led to unrepresentative results. Or our
rhythmic transcription of these passages might have been inaccurate.
So we can't conclude that "the density of syncopation increased over
the 50-year period." Instead, we should say, "the results *are
consistent with* the idea that the density of syncopation increased
over the 50-year period." Similarly, we should say that "our study
*implies* that the variety of syncopation patterns peaked in the
1910s." Notice the use of the words "appears" and "seems" in the
previous paragraph.

#### Methodological Observations

Notice that the study was not motivated by any theory. We did not use
some theory to generate a conjecture, and then refine the conjecture
into a testable hypothesis. The study was, however, motivated by a
question: How did the use of syncopation change in American popular
music over the first 50 years of sound recording? More specifically,
how did the density of syncopation change? And what happened to the
various syncopation patterns?

If you read the actual published article, you'll see that we took care
to avoid defining "syncopation." Instead, we operationally defined a
"lacuna." Many people might be tempted to say that a lacuna is a
pretty good way of defining a syncopation, however, we try to avoid
*essentializing* the concept syncopation. Because we gave a precise
definition of "lacuna" we could unambiguously count them: "this rhythm
has a lacuna right there," "this passage contains no lacunae at all."
Notice that Figure 3 (above) plots the number of *lacunae* (not the
number of *syncopations*---whatever that might be).

In Figure 4, we plotted the "percentage of irregular syncopations."
Once again, in the published article, we operationally defined
something we called "irregular syncopations." Once again, we don't
*believe* that rhythms divide into *regular syncopations* and
*irregular syncopations* (as though these are "natural kinds" of some
sort). This was simply a provisional way of distinguishing commonplace
syncopated patterns from less common ones, and then seeing how often
the less common patterns occurred in different decades.

Notice that our study tells us nothing about causality. It has no
story to tell about *why* something might have happened. Also notice
that the study *did not invite failure*; we did not test an *a priori*
hypothesis or theory. Having presented our observations, the study
might inspire other researchers to form theories regarding why this
happened.
