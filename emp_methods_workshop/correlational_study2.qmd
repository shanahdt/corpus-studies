### The Correlational Study



Correlational studies aim to identify linkages or relationships
between things. We say two things are correlated when there is some
sort of connection or association between them. For example, music
with a fast tempo tends to be louder than music with a slow tempo.
Although there are exceptions to this, in general, there is a
correlation between tempo and dynamic level.

A correlational study involves collecting at least two different sets
of measurements, and determining whether there is any relationship
between the two sets. When we suspect that two measures are
correlated, we should plot the measures, with one measure on the
horizontal axis, and the other measure on the vertical axis. For
example, we might plot the average dynamic level against the average
tempo. Each point will represent a single musical work.

The degree of correlation can be expressed using a numerical
*correlation coefficient.* Correlation coefficients range between -1
and +1. A correlation of +1 means a perfect positive correlation: as
one measure increases, the corresponding measure also increases.
Conversely, a correlation of -1 means a perfect negative correlation:
as one measure increases, the corresponding measure decreases.

An example of a strong positive correlation would be +.89. An example
of a moderate positive correlation would be +.65. An example of a weak
positive correlation would be +.21. Similarly, strong, moderate, and
weak *negative* correlations would simply reverse the sign from
positive to negative. If there is little or no meaningful relationship
between two sets of measures, the correlation will tend to be near
zero---or where the correlation coefficient (of whatever value) is
deemed not to be statistically significant. (Refer to our later
discussion.)

A common type of correlational study is the survey (although many
surveys are descriptive or measurementive rather than correlational).
For example, a survey might reveal that people with high incomes are
more likely to prefer jazz than country music, or that social
conservatives are less likely to enjoy sad music. Once again,
correlational studies say nothing about causation: they simply suggest
that certain relationships exist.

1.  Correlational studies may or may not be hypothesis-driven. When
    there is no *a priori* hypothesis, the study is said to be an
    exploratory correlational study.
2.  Correlational studies always involve at least two sets of
    measurements.
3.  A common type of correlational study is the survey or
    questionnaire.

#### An Example

Both formal field observations and formal experiments have shown that
males tend to prefer slower dance tempos than females. What accounts
for this sex-related difference in preference? One possibility is that
males and females prefer different styles of music. For example, women
are more likely to prefer (generally fast) *dance* music, whereas men
are more likely to prefer (slower) *rock* music. However, the
difference in tempo preference is evident even when women and men are
allowed to "tune" their own preferred dance tempo using a drum machine
programmed to produce a simple *back beat* rhythm of alternating bass
and snare drums.

Sofia Dahl and David Huron (2007) considered an alternative hypothesis
that dance tempo might be correlated with body morphology. Dancing is
essentially stylized bouncing, and like any oscillating system, the
optimum rate of bouncing might be expected to depend on physical
aspects of the moving body---such as height and weight.

Accordingly, Dahl and Huron had participants tune a drum machine to
their preferred dance tempo, and then afterwards made a series of
morphological measures, including the person's height and weight. The
graph below shows a scatterplot for 30 participants. Each point plots
the preferred dance tempo (in beats per minute) against the average
length of the persons's two legs (in centimeters). As can be seen,
there is a general trend downward: people with longer legs tend to
prefer slower tempos. The correlation coefficient is a moderate -.67.

Body weight was found to produce a somewhat weaker correlation of
-.38. That is, heavier people tend to prefer slower dance tempos.
