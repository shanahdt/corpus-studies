### Reactivity

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is a quirky and charming Norwegian film from 2003 entitled
*Kitchen Stories.* The story follows an employee of the fictitious
Swedish Home Research Institute. The researchers are interested in
designing more efficient kitchens. Having studied Swedish
housewives, the researchers are now studying Norwegian bachelor
farmers. Before dawn, the researcher (Forke) takes up his
observation position, perched on a high chair in the corner of the
kitchen. Over the course of the day, he records each time his
observee (Isak) enters the kitchen, and makes detailed notes of each
action --- such as reaching for the salt shaker. Forke and Isak are
under strict instructions not to converse or otherwise interact with
each other. As you can imagine, the film's dry humor derives from
the ridiculousness of the situation.

An important question in any observation is how the presence of the
observer changes the behavior of the observed. This is the problem
of *reactivity.* A situation is said to have high reactivity when
the observer has a major influence on the behavior of the observed.
In the film *Kitchen Stories,* Isak begins eating his meals outside
of the kitchen so that he is no longer under constant surveillance
by Forke.

An example of high reactivity in music research can be found in the
work of ethnomusicologist Marc Perlman. In the process of learning
Indonesian music, Perlman continually pestered his master teachers
with "why" questions. His teachers were quite aware of the Western
tradition of "music theorizing." They were also aware that many
traditional Indonesian musical practices were done with little in
the way of theoretical justification or explanation. Possibly under
the influence of Western ideas, Perlman's teachers also viewed
"theory" as a desireable and prestigious intellectual enterprise.
Over the decades, Perlman observed and chronicled the emergence of a
"music theory" among a handful of respected musicians in Indonesia.
Moreover, Perlman was aware that the development of these
explanatory frameworks was, at least in part, a response to the very
questions posed by ethnomusicologists (including himself) about the
meaning, reasons, or explanations for various Indonesian practices.
The sorts of questions asked by ethnomusicologists are likely to
have been a formative impetus for the development of Indonesian
music theory. In his award-winning book, Perlman (2004) documents
the emergence of music theorizing in Indonesia.

#### Hawthorne Effect

Reactivity effects can be remarkably subtle yet important. A classic
example is the famous *Hawthorne Effect.* The Hawthorne Effect is
named after a manufacturing plant owned by Western Electric. In the
1920s and 1930s Western Electric was interested in the effect of
workplace changes on productivity. Over the course of five years,
they tried many changes: improving the lighting, rearranging
furniture or equipment, improving cleanliness, etc. Each time, they
observed an increased productivity (which fell back to normal after
a month or so). As a control, they also changed the workplaces back
to their original conditions --- reducing the lighting, reducing
cleanliness, replacing the furniture, etc. With each change,
however, they observed the same increase in productivity for a short
period. That is, reducing the lighting was as good as improving the
lighting in terms of productivity increase. It turned out that the
workers were simply reacting to the fact that they were being
observed by a seemingly interested, even sympathetic, management.
The workers were reacting principally to the attention of their
bosses, rather than reacting to the specific changes made in their
workplaces.

#### Historical Reactivity

Reactivity can also be present over long stretches of history. A
young historican, for example, might spend time carefully examining
the diary of a recently deceased composer. Surely, we might think,
the observations made by a modern historian have no effect on what a
dead composer wrote! Unfortunately, things are not so simple.
Diaries are often written with a future audience in mind. When a
living composer today writes in a journal or diary, he or she may
very well have one eye on the future and how future scholars may
view his or her actions, thoughts and emotions. Diaries are not
documents that simply report facts. Diaries are shaped, at least in
part, by how the writer wants to be remembered. Even when writing
nominally private notes, a person may still imagine the presence of
an unseen observer --- looking over his or her shoulder.

This does not mean that the effects of reactivity cannot be
minimized. A historian might find important clues in shopping lists,
tax returns, wills, and other documents that a historical figure
might never have imagined would be examined. At the moment, people
are largely unaware of the volume of personal data being collected
about them from their activities on the Internet. In the future, it
is quite likely that these records will become available to
historians. When this happens, public figures are apt to become far
more circumspect about their behaviors on the Internet. That is,
their behaviors will be shaped, at least in part, by how they want
to be portrayed. A common reactivity problem in interviews and
surveys arises when an interviewee is especially eager to be
perceived as helpful.

In a later discussion, we'll consider *reactivity* problems in more
detail. We'll consider eight techniques for minimizing or
controlling their effects.
