### Clever Hans

------------------------------------------------------------------------

How likely is it that a horse could read German fluently and do
advanced mathematics? The story of *Clever Hans* provides one of the
most illuminating lessons of what can go wrong with research.
Interestingly, there is a musical connection in this story. The
German government hired Carl Stumpf---one of the early famous music
psychologists---to lead the commission of inquiry. Despite detailed
investigation, Stumpf failed to recognize what was going on.

[From Wikipedia:] "Hans was a horse owned by Wilhelm von Osten,
who was a mathematics teacher, an amateur horse trainer,
phrenologist, and something of a mystic. Hans was said to have been
taught to add, subtract, multiply, divide, work with fractions, tell
time, keep track of the calendar, differentiate musical tones, and
read, spell, and understand German. Von Osten would ask Hans, "If
the eighth day of the month comes on a Tuesday, what is the date of
the following Friday?" Hans would answer by tapping his hoof.
Questions could be asked both orally, and in written form. Von Osten
exhibited Hans throughout Germany, and never charged admission."

"Due to the large amount of public interest, the German board of
education appointed a commission to investigate von Osten's
scientific claims. The psychologist Carl Stumpf formed a panel of 13
people, known as the Hans Commission. This commission consisted of a
veterinarian, a circus manager, a Cavalry officer, a number of
school teachers, and the director of the Berlin zoological gardens.
This commission concluded in September 1904 that no tricks were
involved in Hans' performance."

"The commission's work was continued by Oskar Pfungst, who tested
the basis for these claimed abilities by: Isolating horse and
questioner from spectators, so no cues could come from them, using
questioners other than the horse's master. By means of blinders,
varying whether the horse could see the questioner Varying whether
the questioner knew the answer to the question in advance. Using a
substantial number of trials, Pfungst found that the horse could get
the correct answer even if von Osten himself did not ask the
questions, ruling out the possibility of fraud. However, the horse
got the right answer only when the questioner knew what the answer
was, and the horse could see the questioner. He observed that when
von Osten knew the answers to the questions, Hans got 89 percent of
the answers correct, but when von Osten did not know the answers to
the questions, Hans only answered six percent of the questions
correctly."

**Clever Hans Effect:** An experimenter may inadvertently provide
non-verbal (or verbal) cues as to what they hope will happen. People
can be even more tuned-in than a horse in reading body language.
