### From Classicism to Romanticism

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A more sophisticated use of clustering is found in a study by Katelyn
Horn and David Huron (2012). The motivation for this study came from
earlier studies that implied that the minor mode is used differently
in the 19th century compared with other centuries. As you might
expect, music in the minor mode is typically associated with a slower
tempo and with a quieter dynamic level. However, in the 19th century
that association reverses. On average, in the 19th century, music in
the minor mode is faster and louder than music in the major mode (Post
& Huron, 2009). In light of this work, Horn and Huron decided to
investigate how music changes from the 18th century and the 19th
century. Specifically, they focused on the period between 1750 and
1900. This period corresponds to the presumed shift from the so-called
Classicism of the 18th century to the Romanticism of the 19th century.

Horn and Huron assembled a stratefied random sample containing 750
musical works. They sampled 250 works from each of three 50-year
periods: 1750-1800, 1800-1850, and 1850 to 1900. In order to increase
data independence, they sampled no more than two works written by any
given composer.

In order to avoid sampling from just the beginnings of works, they
devised a procedure that allowed a sample to be selected from
throughout the work. Each work or movement was conceptually divided
into "sections." The beginning of a section was operationally defined
as either (1) the beginning of the work, (2) immediately following a
mid-work double barline, (3) immediately following a repeat sign, or
(4) immediately following a new tempo marking or a change of meter.
Having split a work or movement into a sequence of "sections," they
then randomly selected one section from each work. Using this sampling
method, they avoided biasing the sample to how music begins.

Each randomly-selected section was coded according to five properties:
*mode, dynamic level, tempo, articulation,* and *date.* With regard to
mode, they categorized each sampled section as either "obviously
major," "obviously minor," or "not obviously major or minor." With
regard to dynamic level, passages were coded according to the notated
dynamic markings --- such as pianissimo, mezzo piano, or triple forte.
These markings were treated as an ordinal scale ranging from *ppp*,
*pp*, *p*, *mp*, ... to *fff*. The figure below shows that the most
common dynamic marking for the 750 works is *piano* (***p***).

With regard to tempo, they made use of standard Italian tempo terms.
Specifically, they made use of 19 common Italian terms that were
independently ordered from slow to fast. The figure below shows the
percentage of occurrence for the different tempo terms found in the
sample of 750 works. The most common dynamic marking is *allegro*.

With regard to articulation, passages were coded according to the
prevailing texture in the first 4-8 measures of the sampled section.
This was a subjective evaluation on the part of the researchers.
Passages were coded as one of five possibilities: *very staccato,
generally staccato, balanced or unclear, generally legato,* or *very
legato*. The figure below shows the percentage of occurrence for the
different articulations. In general, legato is more common than
staccato.

Having coded the sampled sections for their mode, dynamic, tempo, and
articulation, several cluster analyses were carried out. First, all of
the data from all 750 passages spanning 1750-1900 were analysed. The
resulting dendrogram is shown below.

![](Images/cluster1750_1899.png){width="700"}

The short lines at the bottom of the dendrogram are the "leaves" ---
each line representing one of the 750 sampled passages. The numbers
along the bottom identify specific passages (labelled by number).

Recall that cluster analysis does not tell you the "meaning" or origin
of the groups. It simply tells you that there are statistically
pertinent natural groupings that arise depending on the way you define
similarity. All of the labels on the figure were added by the
researchers. They represent efforts to interpret the meaning of each
cluster and sub-cluster. For example, at the highest level, the tree
exhibits two broad clusters. By examining the individual passages
identified in each of the two clusters it is possible to interpret the
meaning of this split. Roughly 98 percent of the musical passages in
the right-most group were coded in the major mode (with 2 percent
coded as ambiguous modality), whereas roughly 90 percent of the
passages in the left-most group were coded in the minor mode (with 10
percent coded as ambiguous). In other words, the top-level clusters
appear to represent the distinction between major- and minor-mode
passages. Below this, both the major and minor clusters split into two
broad categories. Once again, an examination of the individual
passages suggests that the subdivisions represent the distinction
between loud and quiet passages.

All of the clusters, of course, arise from combinations of the four
musical features: major/minor mode, loud/quiet dynamic, fast/slow
tempo, and staccato/legato articulation. By examining the individual
musical passages, it is possible to identify the characteristics of
each cluster. For example, the left-most cluster arises from the
combination of loud, fast, staccato, and major-mode music. The cluster
immediately to the right represents the combination of quiet, fast,
staccato, and major-mode music. And so on.

As in the case of Johnson's analysis of orchestral clusters into
Standard, Power, and Color instruments, we are free to attempt to
interpret the clusters here. For example, Horn and Huron applied the
label "Joyful" to the major-loud-fast-staccato passages, and the label
"Light/Effervescent" to the major-quiet-fast-staccato passages. It is
important to recognize that these labels are *post-hoc* interpretive
labels. The clusters have some objective basis in the data, but the
labels are subjective impositions. Another researcher might disagree
with these characterizations or offer alternative ways of interpreting
the clusters. Nevertheless, the interpretive labels are useful ways of
referring to the groups arising from the cluster analysis.

In interpreting the results, Horn and Huron made the following
interpretations:

  -------------------------- ----------- ----------- ---------- --------------
  **"Joyful"**               **major**   **loud**    **fast**   **staccato**
  **"Light/Effervescent"**   **major**   **quiet**   **fast**   **staccato**
  **"Regal"**                **major**   **loud**    **slow**   **legato**
  **"Tender Lyrical"**       **major**   **quiet**   **slow**   **legato**
  **"Passionate"**           **minor**   **loud**    **fast**   **staccato**
  **"Sneaky"**               **minor**   **quiet**   **fast**   **staccato**
  **"Sad/Relaxed"**          **minor**   **quiet**   **slow**   **legato**
  **"Serious"**              **minor**   **loud**    **slow**   **legato**
  -------------------------- ----------- ----------- ---------- --------------

Having carried out a cluster analysis for all 750 works, Horn and
Huron then carried out cluster analyses according to each of the
50-year periods. Below is the resulting dendrogram for the earliest
period, 1750 to 1799.

A hundred years later (1850 to 1899), we can see that the musical
samples produce a somewhat different clustering.

![](Images/cluster1850_1899.png){width="700"}

The table below summarizes the changes in clusters across the 150-year
period of the study. The biggest change occurs with
*Light/Effervescent* music. In the late 18th century, this represents
the biggest cluster accounting for nearly 40% of musical passages. By
the end of the 19th century, *Light/Effervescent* has virtually
disappeared according to the sample. A second major change occurs with
*Sad/Relaxed* music. Over the three 50-year periods, the amount of
*Sad/Relaxed* music triples from 7% to 21%. *Passionate* music doubles
(from 4% to 8%), but more importantly, *Tender/Lyrical* music doubles
(from 22% to 44%).

![](Images/clusters_by_epoch.png){width="400"}

In general, the results of the cluster analysis appear to be
consistent with conventional musical interpretations regarding the
historical change between the so-called Classical and Romantic
periods. *Light/Effervescent* music which is so common in the
Classical style nearly disappears. *Joyful* music declines slightly.
Instead, there is a large increase in *Tender/Lyrical* music,
accompanied by lesser increases in *Sad/Relaxed,* and *Passionate*
musics.
