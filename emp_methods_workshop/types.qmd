[GROUP TASK #4:]{.small} Types of Empirical Studies

Identify whether the following studies are best regarded as
*reconnaissance, descriptive, measurement, correlational,* or
*experimental*. If *correlational* or *experimental*, further indicate
whether it is *exploratory correlational* or *exploratory
experimental*.

1.  A researcher publishes an article describing a newly discovered
    box containing composition sketches written by Bart√≥k.
    
2.  While a musician takes a break, an ethnomusicologist clandestinely
    mistunes one of the strings on the instrument by 1/3 of a
    semitone. The ethnomusicologist suspects that the musician will
    notice the mistuning and so retune the instrument.
    
3.  A researcher at *Billboard* magazine assembles and publishes music
    sales by genre for 85 countries.
    
4.  A researcher analyses facial expressions in commercial videos of
    concert pianists. It is found that pianists tend to raise their
    eyebrows when the music is high in overall pitch.
    
5.  A researcher commissions ten composers to create "happy" and "sad"
    melodies. The researcher predicts that the happy melodies will
    exhibit larger melodic intervals than the sad melodies.
    
6.  The manager of an orchestra is interested in identifying which
    repertoire attracts bigger audiences. She gathers audience
    statistics for a number of concerts from several orchestras. She
    classifies each program according to whether the music is
    predominantly Baroque, predominantly Classical, predominantly
    Romantic, predominantly Modern, or predominantly Pops. She finds
    that the largest audiences occur for Pops concerts.
    
7.  A researcher interviews twenty young mothers about singing to
    their newborn infants. He finds most mothers report singing to
    their babies, but that they are more likely to sing when no other
    adult is observing them. The researcher concludes that many young
    mothers are self-conscious about their own singing and prefer not
    to have an audience other than their baby.
    
8.  A researcher is interested in the phenomenon of globalization and
    collects data from different islands in the Kingdom of Tonga. For
    each island, she counts the number of Internet-connected
    computers, and also interviews people in order to determine their
    favorite music. She predicts that islands where people most prefer
    Western pop music will be the islands that are most
    Internet-connected.
    
9.  A school board is interested in the effect of introducing
    non-Western music into the middle school band program. Of eight
    middle schools in the district, four randomly selected middle
    schools include non-Western works in the band repertoire. At the
    end of the year, a sample of music students are interviewed from
    all eight schools in order collect feedback.
    
10. A music theorist carries out analyses of most of the serial works
    by Schoenberg, Webern and Berg. After analyzing the works, the
    theorist publishes a general article comparing and contrasting the
    serial techniques of the three composers. In particular, the
    theorist observes that, compared with the other composers, Webern
    is more likely to compose works structured as extended palindromes
    --- with the material in the second half of the work inverted.
