ADVICE: From past experience, DAY 4 and DAY 5 are now the weakest. The
highlight of DAY 4 is "Writing The Paper First."

Apart from the breaks, it may be useful to have a 5th-inning stretch
from time-to-time.

DAY 3 (Statistics) is now in pretty good shape --- although it is
essential to review the material thoroughly before teaching. With regard
to statistics, there are four tasks awaiting. First, I need to add a
powerpoint/handout on measuring variance. Second, I need to add
z-scores/standard scores. This can be illustrated by my work on the
interval "preference" in J.S. Bach. Third, I really ought to have a
section on measuring effect size. Measuring Cohen's d is very
straightfoward. There is a very nice website with an excellent dynamic
demonstration at: http://rpsychologist.com/d3/cohend/ Moreover, a
segment on measuring variance would set the stage for measuring Cohen's
d. Fourth, I need to complete my handout on "Some advanced statistics
(Introduction)."

FINAL DAY: Running subjects can be excessively slow if there are a lot
of participants. Next time, consider running subjects in the Ethno Lab
and 504 so things move more quickly. On FINAL DAY, it is appropriate to
have lunch with the participants. On FINAL DAY, one of the students
brought cookies (home-baked snacks). I should do that on DAY 5 --- was
well appreciated on the final day. On FINAL DAY, I stayed until 6PM to
converse with participants. People really appreciated that.
