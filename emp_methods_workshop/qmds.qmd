### Multi-Dimensional Scaling

------------------------------------------------------------------------




In simple terms, multi-dimensional scaling amounts to *creating a
map from a list of distances.*

Suppose we have a list of the distances between major European
cities. The distance between London and Berlin is 933 kilometers.
Between London and Rome it is 1,435 kilometers. Between Berlin and
Rome it is 1,184 kilometers. And so on. A computer program can be
used to construct a map, simply using the distances. For example,
the program begins by arbitrarily placing one of the cities (say
London) on a blank page. With London in the center, it then draws a
circle with a radius of 933 kilometers; Berlin lies somewhere on
this circle. Similarly, it draws another circle with a radius of
1,435 kilometers; Rome lies somewhere on this circle. It then
chooses a point on the first (Berlin) circle, so that it is 1,184
kilometers from a point on the second (Rome) circle. It continues in
this way until all of the cities have been plotted.

The first thing to notice about this map is that the orientation of
the map is undefined. The map could be drawn with "North" in any
direction. Moreover, it could also draw the map inside-out. We are
used to viewing maps from the "above" perspective --- as though the
viewer is floating in the sky. However, our resulting map might have
been produced as though the viewer were positioned below ground
looking up.

The second thing to notice about the map is that it will require a
slight amount of "stretching." The distance measures are not exact,
so the point representing a given city might be pushed or pulled a
little bit. Technically, the amount of stretching is referred to as
*stress.* Each multi-dimensional scaling solution (each map) will be
accompanied by a numerical value representing the total stress.

If the stress becomes too great, the MDS solution will add an
additional dimension. Suppose for example, that our map included
major cities of the world, not just European cities. You cannot draw
a map of the world in two-dimensions while preserving accurate
distances. The MDS solution will "pop" into three dimensions, and we
will soon see that the positions of the various world cities are
best represented using a three-dimensional sphere.

What's important is that MDS constructs these "maps" from lists of
paired distances. MDS is quite robust --- so that the distances
don't have to be exact. Suppose, for example, that we asked you to
*estimate* all of the distances between various major cities? What
is the distance between London and Berlin? Perhaps you guess 1,000
kilometers (instead of 933). What is the distance between London and
Rome? Perhaps you guess 1,700 kilometers. (instead of 1,435). And so
on. Based solely on these distance estimates, MDS will manage to
create a remarkably convincing map. Once again, it will do some
"stretching" to make things fit. But the map from estimated
distances will typically be very close to the map for the real
distances --- although the "stress" value will be higher.

Now suppose we use this technique, not to represent physical
distances, but psychological distances. By way of example, John Grey
(1977) played pairs of tones to listeners (e.g., clarinet and flute,
clarinet and trumpet, clarinet and violin, etc.), and asked
participants to judge the similarity of the tones on a numerical
scale. Using this approach, the average distance between clarinet
and flute might be 3.6, whereas the distance between clarinet and
xylophone might be 9.1. With enough paired comparisons, Grey could
use MDS to portray the sounds in a multi-dimensional space, where
similar timbres are close to each other.

Grey's tones were mapped in a three-dimensional space. MDS does not
"label" the dimensions. That interpretation is left to the
researcher. By traversing through the tones along a single
dimension, one can hear what changes along that dimension. In this
way, Grey was able to interpret one of the dimensions as
"brightness." Sounds at one end tended to be darker, and they got
brighter as one moved along the dimension. Grey was able to
interpret another dimension as the percussiveness of the sound, and
so on. In short, MDS allows the researcher to glimpse the underlying
factors used by listeners when judging the similarity of the tones.

In general, multi-dimensional scaling starts with a matrix of
item-item similarities, and then plots the items in some space so as
to preserve the similarity relationships. similarity values as
input. MDS is an exploratory data analysis method that allows the
research to view items of interest in some sort of spatial
representation where distances are meaningful.

#### Pitch

Suppose we played many pairs of pitches and asked people to judge
"the similarity" between the pitches. We might provide a scale of 1
to 10, where 1 is very close, and 10 is very distant. A listener
might judge the pitches D4 and D#4 to be "quite similar" and give
them a value of "2." Conversely, the pitches C2 and F#6 miths be
deemeds very different, and be given a value of "9."

Of course, pitches can be "similar" in other ways. For example,
listeners might judge the pitches E3 and E4 to sound "quite
similar." As a result, the similarity ratings between E3 and E4
might be quite close --- say "1."

This state of affairs might lead to a seemingly odd arrangement. On
the one hand E4 might be very similar to D#4; E4 might also be very
similar to E5; however, D#4 might be heard as rather dissimilar to
E5. Dispite this apparent paradox, multi-dimensional scaling will
have no difficulty dealing with the situation.

The figure below arises from the MDS solution based on judgments of
pitch similarity. Notice that the MDS solution is three dimensional.
Two dimensions (circular) relate to what musicians would call
pitch-class --- what psychologists refer to as pitch chroma. The
third dimension relates to the octave --- what psychologists refer
to as pitch height. It can be seen that in this solution, the pitch
E4 is near both D#4 and E5. That is, the two-dimensional solution
captures both of the ways in which pitches can be similar.

#### Medieval Modes

Huron and Veltman (2006) made use of MDS in their study of medieval
modes. They assembled a quota sample of Gregorian chants in the
eight classic modes: Dorian, hypodorian, phrygian, hypophrygian,
lydian, hypolydian, mixolydian, and hypomixolydian. For each mode,
they tallied the distributions of the various pitches. They then
measured the similarity of the distributions between all pairs of
modes: dorian/hypodorian, dorian/phrygian, etc. These distances were
then used in a multidimensional scaling procedure. The resulting
modal "map" is shown below.

Those modes that are closest together in the MDS solution are the
most similar in terms of their pitch distributions. For example, the
two modes in the lower left of the graph (hypomixolydian and
phrygian) turn out to be statistically indistinguishable.

In the 11th century, a music scholar named Johannes Cotto described
the modal system from both theoretical and applied perspectives.
Although the theory distinguishes eight separate modes, Cotto
suggested that there are only really four modes. These are
illustrated in the graph by the circles. Cotto deemed hypdorian and
mixolydian as truly separate modes. But the remaining modes group
into two practical modes. One group consists of dorian, hypolydian,
and hypophrygian. A second group consists of phrygian, lydian, and
hypmixolydian. The latter modes all share the pitch C as the tenor
tone and appear on the left side of the map. The former modes all
share the pitch A as the tenor.

Dimensions 1 and 2 are drawn to scale making it easier to see that
Dimension 1 accounts for a greater proportion of the variance. Note
the large empty region separating the left and right mode clusters.
Dimension 1 suggests a nascent major/minor bifurcation. Although the
musical practice represented in the sampled music pre-dates the
emergence of major/minor tonality, the results suggest that the
possibility for confusion between the modes is already evident in
late medieval music, and that the preeminent polarity of confusion
is consistent with the later major/minor distinction.
