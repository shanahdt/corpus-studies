[GROUP TASK #22:]{.small} Strengths and Weakness

The purpose of this exercise is to assess your research situation, to
identify strengths and limitations, and to determine what courses of
action are needed to make you a better researcher.

In groups, discuss each item in turn, then (privately) rate yourself
according to the various criteria. Rate yourself on a scale from 1 to
5, where 1 means *not prepared at all* and 5 means *well prepared*.

Finally, on the reverse of this page, make an ordered list of your
weaknesses (especially items scored "1" or "2"). Identify any other
criteria that you think are pertinent to pursuing your research
interests. Then prioritize the items. They represent your priorities
for improving your capacity for research.
