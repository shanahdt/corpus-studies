### Types of Failure

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In making any knowledge claim (including the claim that something is
unknowable) there are two kinds of errors we can make.
Methodologists call these *Type I* and *Type II errors.* It doesn't
matter whether the source of a knowledge claim is *intuition,
deductive,* or *empirical.*

#### Skepticism

At least since the time of the ancient Greeks, the essence of
scholarship has been *skepticism.* There are two kinds of
skepticism: (1) False positive skepticism, and (2) False negative
skepticism. A false positive skeptic is afraid of making knowledge
claims that aren't correct. A false negative skeptic is afraid of
discarding ideas that might have value. A false positive skeptic is
ready to discard an idea given a small amount of contradicting
evidence. A false negative skeptic requires overwhelming
contradicting evidence before giving up on an idea.

The two forms of skepticism are evident in everyday statements such
as the following:

**False Positive Skeptic:**
"You don't know that for sure."
"I really doubt that that's useful."
"There's no way you could ever know that."
"There's not enough evidence for me to believe that."

**False Negative Skeptic:**
"It might well be true."
"It could yet prove to be useful."
"We might know more than we think."
"There's not enough evidence for me to stop believing ..."

In short, the two forms of skepticism might be summarized by the
following contrasting assertions:

*False-Positive Skeptic:* "There is insufficient evidence to
support that."
*False-Negative Skeptic:* "There is insufficient evidence to
reject that."

There is nothing inherently superior about one form of skepticism
compared with the other. All of us rely on both types of skepticism
in our lives.

People who engage in research are optimists, since they must think
that through their own actions it may be possible to acquire new
knowledge. People who are pessimistic about knowledge claims
typically don't engage in research, since they are skeptical about
the possibility of generating new knowledge.

Since researchers are typically hopeful and optimistic, the
principal danger in empirical research is our own eagerness to
discover something. For this reason, active researchers are more
likely to make Type I errors (i.e., claiming something to be true
that is not true/useful/knowable) than Type II errors. Consequently,
throughout the history of empirical research, the principal concern
has been to minimize or avoid Type I errors.

As we will see later, when research involves quantitative data, it
is often possible to estimate the probability of making a Type I or
Type II error. Although modern science is several hundred years old,
the ability to measure the probability of error is less than a
century old, and is one of the most important advances in modern
empirical methodology.

#### Recap

What's a Type I Error? *Wrongly claiming something to be true,
useful or knowable.*
What's a Type II Error? *Wrongly claiming something to be false,
useless or unknowable.*
In quantitative empirical research, it is often possible to estimate
the probability of making either error.

"But as for certain truth, no man has known it
Nor will he know it; neither of the gods,
Nor yet of all the things of which I speak.
And if by chance he were to utter
The final truth, he would himself not know it:
For all is but a woven web of conjectures."

- Xenophanes
