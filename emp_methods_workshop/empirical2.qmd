## Types of Empirical Studies


### Introduction

Many of the things music scholars do is empirical---in the sense that
the activities involve *observation.* Examples might include
deciphering manuscripts, studying a score, or observing a gamelan
rehearsal. What makes "empirical research" different from the tasks
that humanities scholars typical engage in?

A distinction can be made between *formal* and *informal* observation.
An informal observation might simply be noticing that there are more
women than men on the dance floor of a club. Another informal
observation might involve recognizing that a printed score switches
from using the abbreviated "sfz" marking to the verbose "sforzando" in
the final pages. Formal observation is distinguished by some sort of
prior procedure. The researcher *plans* to observe specific things.
For example, a researcher might view videos of two performers with the
aim of determining which performer moves more while playing. Or a
researcher might search through old newspapers from November 1884 in
order to determine if any reviews of a concert were published. What
makes something [E]{.ul}mpirical [R]{.ul}esearch is that the
observations are planned in advance.

At least seven types of empirical studies can be distinguished: (1)
reconnaissance study, (2) descriptive study, (3) measurement study,
(4) correlational study, (5) experimental study, (6) meta-study, and
(7) modeling study.

### 1. Reconnaissance Study

A reconnaissance study is a preliminary or exploratory investigation
intended to gain familiarity with a new field or phenomenon. Charles
Darwin spent five years sailing around the world on the Beagle: the
purpose was exploration and reconnaissance. The goal was to see what
plants and animals existed in different parts of the world.

An ethnomusicologist might travel to a remote village simply to become
exposed to the culture and music of that region. A historical
musicologist might browse through the uncatalogued contents of an
archive box, simply to see what is there. A music sociologist might
interview some pre-teens about their musical tastes, simply to become
aware of their concerns and enthusiasms.

Reconnaissance studies are not hypothesis-driven and do not include
any quantitative measurement. Reconnaissance studies are common when a
researcher begins work on a novel topic or discovers a new phenomenon.
The principal purpose of the reconnaissance study is to alert the
researcher to new possibilities. The research endeavors to cast a wide
net, trying to observe anything that might be potentially informative.
Reconnaissance studies may involve some sort of *collecting,* such as
recording live music, purchasing local CDs and tapes, clipping
magazine or newspaper articles, video recording children's play
activities, etc.

### 2. Descriptive Study

Descriptive studies attempt to document and *interpret* some
phenomenon. Like the reconnaissance study, descriptive studies are not
hypothesis-driven and do not involve any quantitative measurement. The
principal purpose of the descriptive study is to understand some
phenomenon through detailed description and interpretation. When the
phenomenon pertains to people, descriptive studies are usually refered
to as *ethnographic studies.* When the phenomenon is a musical work,
descriptive studies commonly take the form of *analyses.* When the
phenomenon pertains to understanding the past, descriptive studies are
commonly called *historical studies.* There are innumerable
descriptive methods, including *open interviews* and
*participant-observation* methods---which will be covered in detail
later.

#### Description - Thick and Thin

In ethnography, the difference between Reconnaissance and Descriptive
studies is echoed in the terms *thin description* and *thick
description* (Denzin, 1989). Thin description emphasizes what might be
regarded as factual reporting, whereas thick description emphasizes
how the phenomenon is interpreted or understood---usually within a
culture context (Geertz, 1973). In ethnography, both Reconnaissance
and Descriptive studies entail some sort of fieldwork in which one
establishes rapport with the members of a community of interest,
selects local informants or research collaborators, and begins
recording or documenting various observations, commonly in a field
diary. However, "thick description" expands the enterprise, mostly by
emphasizing the *context* of various phenomena, interpreting the
behaviors in terms of intentions and meanings, and tracing the
historical changes of development of the activity.

Note that descriptive ethnographic studies carried out in the field
are often referred to as *field studies.*

### 3. Measurement Study

Like the reconnaissance and descriptive studies, the measurement study
is not hypothesis-driven. However, the researcher engages in some
quantitative activity. That is, the researcher counts or measures
something.

When a paleoanthropologist discovers the skull of a long dead human
ancestor, the first order of business is to describe the skull by
reporting a series of detailed measurements. Publishing a detailed
description is useful, even if the anthropologist has no opinion or
interpretation to offer, and no theory or hypothesis to test.

Measurement studies often present so-called *descriptive statistics*.
A descriptive statistic is a measurement without any accompanying
interpretive claim. Examples of descriptive statistics: the average
American listens to four hours of music each day; the average European
folksong is 52 notes in length. Measurement studies and descriptive
statistics may invite a "so what?" response. Their value usually lies
in later studies that make use of the published measurements.

The principal purpose of the measurement study is to assemble
quantitative descriptors of some phenomenon, with a minimum of
interpretation. A famous historical example of a measurement study is
the classic work of the Danish astronomer, Tycho Brahe (1546-1601).
Brahe built the most sophisticated telescope of his era and devised
ways to measure the positions of celestial bodies with excellent
precision. His measurements of the positions of the stars and planets
were far more accurate than earlier measures. His work formed the
basis for the later theories of Johannes Kepler, who determined that
the planets moved in elliptical orbits. Brahe himself did not discover
the elliptical orbits of the planets, but his careful measurements
provided an essential precursor to that discovery.

### 4. Correlational Study

Correlational studies aim to identify linkages or relationships
between things. We say two things are correlated when there is some
sort of connection or association between them. For example, music in
the minor mode tends to be slower in tempo than music in the major
mode. Although there are exceptions to this, in general, there is a
*correlation* between mode and tempo.

Correlational studies always involve some form of measurement or
counting. In fact, correlational studies involve collecting at least
two different sets of measurements. The aim is to determine whether
there is any relationship between the two sets of measurements. For
example, a survey of middle-school students might find that more
female than male students play flute, while more male than female
students play trombone. That is, we might find a correlation between
gender and instrumentation. Correlational studies cannot be used to
identify causation. The study itself gives us no idea of *why* a
particular association might exit.

A common type of correlational study is the *survey* (although many
surveys are descriptive or measurementive rather than correlational).
For example, a survey might reveal that people with high incomes are
more likely to prefer jazz than country music, or that social
conservatives are less likely to enjoy sad music. Once again,
correlational studies say nothing about causation: they simply suggest
that certain relationships exist.

#### Exploratory Correlational Study

Correlational studies may or may not be hypothesis-driven. In many
cases, the researcher has an explicit interest in testing whether a
proposed relationship exists. In other cases, the researcher has no
prior hypothesis to test and may be looking to see if anything
correlates with a concept of interest. When the study is motivated by
an *a priori* hypothesis, the principal purpose of the correlational
study is to test an idea by inviting failure. When no prior hypothesis
is being tested, the study is referred to as an *exploratory
correlational study*.

### 5. Experimental Study

A study is "experimental" when the researcher *manipulates* some
aspect of the world. For example, an experimenter may expose listeners
to musical excerpts that vary from sad to happy and observe the effect
of the different moods on, say, memory. The property that is
manipulated by the researcher (in this case mood) is referred to as
the *independent variable*. The property that is observed by the
researcher (in this case memory recall) is referred to as the
*dependent variable* (or dependent measure).

Experimental studies are nearly always hypothesis-driven. That is, the
researcher makes a prediction about the effect of manipulating the
independent variable on the dependent variable. When
hypothesis-driven, the experiment is referred to as a *true
experiment*. All experiments involve some sort of measurement.
Experiments may involve more than one independent variables and more
than one dependent variables. The principal purpose of the
experimental study is to test an idea by inviting failure.

Of all the different kinds of studies, the experimental study is the
most highly regarded by empirical researchers. There is a reason for
this: the experimental study is the only type of study that allows the
researcher to say something about causation.

#### Exploratory Experiment

An *Exploratory Experiment* involves manipulation and measurement, but
the manipulation is not motivated by some prior theory, hypothesis or
conjecture. For example, a researcher might play traditional Japanese
and Andean pop music to naive Western listeners while making a series
of measurements, such as heart-rate, respiration, body temperature,
and observable behavior, etc. The researcher may have no idea what to
expect. That is, no prediction was made. Nevertheless, having
collected the data, the researcher might then carry out statistical
tests to see whether a significant increase in body temperature
resulted. Notice that the study involves manipulation of the world
(playing different kinds of the music), but the study is not motivated
by some prior theory or idea.

### 6. Meta Study

A meta-study is a "study of studies." It is typically done when a
large number of studies have been carried out related to some problem.
For example, many studies have been carried out related to whether
television violence promotes violent behavior in viewers. Some of the
studies seem to show a link, whereas other studies seem to show no
link. In a meta-analysis, the researchers identify all of the
pertinent studies. They then evaluate the quality of each study,
including the quality of the samples used, the number of participants,
the quality of the stimuli, the extensiveness of the controls, and
other factors. Poor studies are simply discarded if they fail to
achieve the minimum quality criteria established by the researchers.
Then the researchers combine together all of the good studies, and do
a statistical analysis on the aggregate data. The principal purpose of
the meta-study is to determine whether all of the studies pertaining
to some topic ultimately tell a coherent story.

### 7. Modeling Study

Theories can often be implemented as models. An example of a *physical
model* is a large model of San Francisco Bay built by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers (see photo). The actual bay is 100 km long. The
model is 1 km in length so the scale is 1 meter = 100 meters. Models
are useful for testing hypotheses that are impossible (or unethical)
to test in reality. For example, how long will it take an oil spill in
Oakland to reach the mouth of the Sacramento River?

Physical models are rather rare. More commonly, models are rendered as
computer programs. There are a number of commercial software products
designed explicitly to help researchers build models. Models might be
used, for example, to predict the spread in popularity of South Korean
pop music introduced into North Korea. Or a model might be used to
predict a listener's musical preferences based on past listening
habits.

An advantage of models is that they can be used to investigate
"what-if" scenarios. The researcher can change some of the initial
states, and then see what happens when the model is set in motion.
Running a model with a set of initial conditions is referred to as a
*simulation.*

The principal purpose of a modeling study is to build a model that has
some predictive value related to some phenomenon. In general, few
models have been created related to musical phenomenon. Models are
more common in disciplines that have a mature research base to build
on.

Golden Gate Bridge can be seen near the center of the photo.)*

### Pilot Study

Whatever type of study one uses, it is often useful to begin with a
sort of "practice" study---known as a *pilot study*. A pilot study is
carried out simply as a way of testing the research procedure. Pilot
studies usually involve relatively small numbers of participants or
small sample sizes. Pilot studies can prove very useful by exposing
various unanticipated problems that help the researcher fine-tune an
ensuing *main study.* The principal purpose of a pilot study is to
determine whether a full-fledged study is feasible and to uncover
possible problems with the research design.

### Mixed Methods

It is not uncommon for a published journal article to report several
different studies, often presenting different types of studies within
a single report. The research might begin by reporting a descriptive
study. The results from the descripive study may inspire the authors
to formulate a theory, from which a hypothesis is generated. The
article might then go on to report a correlational study or an
experiment whose purpose is to explicitly test the hypothesis.
Frequently, two or more experiments are reported, with each succesive
experiment aimed at testing a different refinement of the initial
hypothesis. The resulting report is said to make use of "mixed
methods."

### Natural Experiments

A special kind of experiment is the so-called *natural experiment.* A
natural experiment relies on a manipulation of the real world that
occurs without the intervention of the researcher. In the field of
climatology, the best-known example of a natural experiment relates to
the influence of commercial aircraft on heating of the earth's
surface. Everyday, thousands of aircraft fly---creating vapor trails
that often produce "linear clouds." What effect do these vapor trails
have on the earth's temperature? On the one hand, the clouds partially
block the sun and reflect light back into space---suggesting that
their presence cools the earth. On the other hand, the clouds tend to
insulate the earth---reflecting heat radiating from the earth back
toward the surface. So what effect do vapor trails have on the earth's
temperature?

The effect (if any) of vapor trails is difficult to observe against
the constantly fluctuating general weather patterns. Vapor trails are
relatively small, often temporary, and winds in the upper atmosphere
blow them so they don't hover over the same point on the earth. It is
almost impossible to measure the effect of a single vapor trail.
Ideally, it would be helpful to carry out an experiment. Imagine if an
experimenter could manipulate the world---banning all air traffic on
one day, and then having the skies filled with aircraft the next day?
This would allow the calculation of the average surface temperature
over a very large geographical area, and so allow the researcher to
test whether the vapor trails tend to cool or warm the earth. This is
the sort of experiment meterologists dream about, but obviously it is
impractical.

In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the
US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) shut down all air traffic across
the United States for three days. Although this event was a tragedy of
the first order, it offered an unexpected opportunity for climate
researchers and meterologists to measure the effect of vapor trails on
the surface temperature of the earth. Scientist David Travis averaged
the daily highs and lows for some 4,000 locations across the U.S. and
compared temperatures during the FAA ban, with data when the planes
were flying. This natural experiment allowed researchers to determine
that vapor trails raise nighttime temperatures and lower daytime
temperatures. That is, at night, the presence of vapor trails reduces
heat-loss, but during the day they block sunlight. Moreover, the
natural experiment also established that the main overall effect is to
lower daytime temperatures. Contrary to the views of some
climatologists, vapor trails appear to have a net cooling effect on
the earth. The effect is about 1 degree C.

In this case, the sort of manipulation researchers could only dream
of, arose due to other (non-research) circumstances. From
time-to-time, it is possible to carry out such "natural experiments."

### Taxonomy

In general, it is helpful to classify studies according to four
criteria:

1.  Does the researcher simply describe and observe? Or does the
    researcher offer an interpretation or *explanation*? (That is,
    does the study offer an explanatory theory?)
2.  Does the researcher make a *prediction*? (That is, does the method
    invite failure?)
3.  Does the researcher *manipulate* the world? (That is, does the
    method allow the researcher to infer causality?) And
4.  Does the researcher count or measure something? (That is, is the
    research qualitative or *quantitative*?)

*Reconnaissance* and *Descriptive studies* involve no manipulation, no
hypothesis test, and no measurement. They differ in whether the
researcher *interprets* the observed phenomenon. *Measurement studies*
involve no manipulation and no hypothesis test---they simply report
some sort quantitative measures. An *Experimental study* involves
manipulation, testing of a hypothesis, and (necessarily) some
measurement. An *Exploratory Experiment* involves manipulation and
measurement, but no hypothesis testing. A *Correlational study*
involves no manipulation, but it does involve measurement. Usually,
correlational studies also involve the testing of a hypothesis. If a
correlational study involves no hypothesis, then it is an *Exploratory
Correlational study.* (What researchers commonly call an "Exploratory
study" is either an *Exploratory Experiment* or an *Exploratory
Correlational study.*)

### Exploratory Methods versus Testing Methods

The single most important distinction between types of empirical
studies is whether a theory *precedes* data collection (*a priori*) or
whether a theory *follows after* data collection (*post hoc*). Only *a
priori* methods invite failure. That is, only *a priori* studies
partake of the rhetoric of prophecy.

Methodologists commonly group together all *pre-theory* methods under
the term *exploratory studies*. This includes *reconnaissance studies,
descriptive studies,* *studies,* and *exploratory experiments.* Since
exploratory studies don't test prior hypotheses, they are rhetorically
(and methodologically) relatively weak. Exploratory studies cannot
show that a researcher's theory or hypothesis is wrong. So the scholar
who engages in only exploratory research will never suffer the
indignity of "being wrong."

By contrast, there are three types of *a priori* studies: the
(non-exploratory) correlational study, the (non-exploratory)
experiment, and the meta-study. In these types of studies, the
researcher states the hypothesis in advance, and assembles data in
order to perform a test. Since the researcher invites failure, these
types of studies are rhetorically (and methodologically) stronger.

In contrast to *exploratory* methods, these stronger methods are
commonly dubbed *confirmatory.* However, this terminology is
unfortunate. In empirical research, there is no such thing as "proof,"
and similarly, there is no such things as "confirming" a hypothesis.
Instead, researchers *test* hypotheses; if the hypothesis survives the
test, then we simply say that "the results are consistent with the
hypothesis." Although the terms "exploratory" and "confirmatory" are
commonly heard, it is better to characterize methods as either
"exploratory" or "testing."

### Fishing Expeditions

Most correlational studies involve testing some hypothesis. However,
depending on the status of the hypothesis, the correlational study may
be either *exploratory* or *testing* (confirmatory). If the hypothesis
is formulated in advance, then the collected data may provide a proper
test of the hypothesis. In other cases, the data might be assembled
and relationships sought without any initial idea of what to expect. A
researcher may begin testing several possible relationships with the
data. This exploratory approach is informally referred to as a
"fishing expedition." The researcher is "fishing&148; around for
possible connections.

### Disguising Exploratory Studies as Non-Exploratory Studies

A grave methodological error can occur when a researcher engages in an
exploratory study, but presents the work as though it were a true
experiment or hypothesis-testing correlational study. Notice that this
implies that the researcher had the idea before seeing the data and so
gives the audience or readers the impression that the statistical
tests invited failure. However, since the test was carried out only
after the data were seen, there is no chance for the researcher to be
wrong. Presenting *post hoc* hypotheses as though they are *a priori*
hypotheses is morally reprehensible in the same way that making-up
data is unethical.
