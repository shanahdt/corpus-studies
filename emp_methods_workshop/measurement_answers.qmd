[GROUP TASK #12:]{.small} Measurement Scales - ANSWERS

For each case, identify the kind of measurement scale implied ---
either *nominal, ordinal, interval,* or *ratio.*

1.  Works categorized as either *ragtime*, *stride bass*, *big band*,
    *bebop*, *Dixieland*, *free jazz* or *other*.

    *Nominal:* These are named categories.

2.  The age of audience members.

    *Ratio:* Zero is meaningful. A doubling of age (from 20 to 40)
    is a true doubling.

3.  Year of birth for audience members.

    *Interval:* The year "0" has no special meaning; The year 1000
    A.D. is not half as old as 2000 A.D.

4.  The participant's sex, coded as *male* or *female.*

    *Nominal:* These are named categories.

5.  Interval size in semitones.

    *Ratio*: Zero has meaning, namely a unison distance. Twelve
    semitones is twice six semitones.

6.  Year of composition.

    *Interval*: The year "0" has no special meaning; The year 1000
    A.D. is not half as old as 2000 A.D.

7.  Either: *medieval, renaissance, baroque, classical, romantic,* or
    *modern*.

    *Ordinal:* There is a rank ordering in terms of history, but the
    distances between successive items is not the same.

8.  Dynamic level, according to the scale: *ppp, pp, p, mp, mf, f,
    ff,* or *fff*.

    *Ordinal:* There is a rank order, but the distances between
    successive items is not necessarily the same.

9.  The skin temperature of listeners in Fahrenheit.

    *Interval*: Recall that zero degrees has no special meaning. One
    hundred degrees is not twice as warm as fifty degrees.

10. Watts of power produced by an amplifier.

    *Ratio:* Zero watts means there is no power at all.

11. A list of instruments.

    *Nominal:* These are named categories.

12. A list of instruments from brightest to darkest timbres.

    *Ordinal:* There is a rank order from brightest to darkest, but
    the distance between neighboring instruments on the list is not
    constant.

13. MIDI key numbers (e.g., middle C = 60).

    *Interval*: notice that MIDI key "0" has no special meaning
    and that MIDI key "60" (C4) is not "twice as much or twice as
    high" as MIDI key "30" (F#2).

14. Coded S, A, T or B.

    *Ordinal:* There is a rank order in terms of pitch height.
    However, the distance in tessitura is not necessarily the same.
    For example, the distance between the bass and the tenor might
    well be larger than the distance between the soprano and the
    alto.

15. Number of hours of practice.

    *Ratio*: Zero has meaning (no practice at all); 2 hours of
    practice is twice as much as 4 hours of practice.

16. IQ.

    *Interval:* Zero has no special meaning. Instead "100" has a
    special meaning, namely the average intelligence. A person who
    has an IQ of "200" is not twice as smart as the average
    person.

17. Number of instruments.

    *Ratio*: Zero has a special meaning. Four instruments is half of
    eight instruments.

18. Reaction times in milliseconds.

    *Ratio*: Zero has a special meaning; 50 milliseconds is half 100
    milliseconds.

19. Three categories: (1) Obviously major, (2) obviously minor, or (3)
    not obviously major or minor.

    *Nominal:* These are named categories.

20. The amount of money a busker makes per hour.

    *Ratio*: Zero has meaning; $6/hr is twice as much as $3/hr.

21. Length of hairpin markings in centimeters.

    *Ratio*: Zero means no distance at all. Six centimeters is twice
    the distance of three centimeters.

22. The notated key of a passage.

    *Nominal:* These are named categories, like F major or B-flat
    minor.

23. The loudness of each instrument, measured in *decibels*.

    *Interval:* This is really a trick question that requires
    special knowledge. Most people don't know that zero decibels
    doesn't mean the absence of sound. It means a sound of 0.0002
    dynes per square centimeter, which is considered the quietest
    sound that a normal person can just hear. The total absence of
    sound is undefined in the decibel scale, making the scale an
    interval scale rather than a ratio scale.

24. The number of sharps (positive) or flats (negative) in a key
    signature. (E.g., F# & C# = +2; Bb = -1.)

    *Ratio or interval*: A difficult question. If one is thinking
    purely in terms of the notational symbols, then zero has a
    special meaning --- i.e., no sharp or flat symbols. This would
    make the scale a *ratio* scale. However, it is likely that the
    researcher is thinking in terms of the circle of fifths. One
    might argue that there is nothing special about C major/A minor
    compared with other keys. D major might have twice the number of
    sharps as G major, but does G major have infinitely more sharps
    than C major? If the researcher is thinking in terms of the
    circle of fifths, then no sharps or flats is not special, and
    therefore the measurement would be considered an *interval*
    scale.

25. Responses: *never, rarely, sometimes, frequently, always*.

    *Ordinal:* We can't say that the distance between *never* and
    *rarely* is the same as the distance between *sometimes* and
    *frequently*.

26. Musical preference on a 7-point scale:

      ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------
      **like**   ◉          ◉          ◉          ◉          ◉          dislike

      ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------

    *Interval*: respondents tend to treat the points as positions
    along a hypothetical line; although there is no meaningful
    "zero" position, one can interpret the distances between
    successvie points as meaningful.
