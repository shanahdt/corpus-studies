### Instruments

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In research, it is common to make use of standardized tests or
measures called "instruments." An instrument is often in the form of
a questionnaire, but there are many instruments that involve tests
of various sorts, including physical tests. Common instruments
include the *Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale* (WAIS), the
*Scholastic Aptitude Test* (SAT), and the *Minnesota Multiphasic
Personality Inventory* (MMPI).

People aiming to become firefighters are typically required to pass
a series of tests, including a *Firefighter Physical Fitness Test*
(FPFT). For example, this test includes such tasks as carrying a 75
pound (34 kilo) weight up five floors and using a 9-pound (4 kilo)
sledgehammer to drive a 160-pound (73 kilo) steel beam on a Keiser
Force Machine.

There are literally hundreds of instruments which endeavor to
measure a wide variety of concepts. These include such tests as the
Kinsey scale of sexual orientation (KSRS), the Biddle Agility Test,
the Authentic Happiness Inventory Questionnaire, the World Health
Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire (WHOQOL), and many many
more.

#### Norm-referenced and Criterion-referenced

Instruments are either *norm-referenced* or *criterion-referenced*.
A norm-referenced instrument compares the candidate with the general
population. An IQ test is an example of a norm-referenced instrument
since an IQ score of 100 is (by definition) the average
intelligence. A criterion-referenced instrument compares the
candidate with some standard level of achievement. The FPFT
instrument is criterion-referenced --- few people would be able to
complete the physical tasks demanded for prospective firefighters.

Psychologists have created a large number of instruments intended to
measure a wide variety of attributes. For example, the *Beck
Depression Inventory* is intended to characterize how depressed a
person feels.

#### Validity and Reliability

A useful instrument must be both *reliable* and *valid*. Reliability
relates to the consistency of the score. A test is said to be
reliable when a person scores the same value over time in similar
circumstances. Sometimes the reliability has to do with the
consistency of the raters. For example, the Royal Conservatory of
Music (in Canada) has a graded system for musical performance,
ranging from grade 1 to 10. Performance examinations are held across
the country twice each year. The RCM trains examiners in an effort
to make the grading criterion as consistent as possible, so that the
final score received doesn't depend on who the examiner is. If the
adjudication method varies from rater to rater, then the instrument
is said to have a low reliability.

*Validity* relates to whether the instrument measures what it
purports to measure. One might claim that an instrument measures
"musicality" when it really measures "performance skill." Or one
might claim that an instrument measures "feeling sad" when it really
measures "the degree to which someone is willing to say they feel
sad." Etc. A purported test of "intelligence" might be better
characterized as a measure of "language facility" or "logical
reasoning." In the case of music, the Seashore Tests of Musical
Ability are better regarded as tests of "auditory perceptual
acuity."

Many tests are used for diagnostic purposes, such as the
Comprehensive Aphasia Test (CAT) or the Luria-Nebraska
Neuropsychological Battery. The first test you ever underwent was
probably the Apgar test. All newborns are given a Apgar score
between 0 and 10 according to color, pulse, reflex responsiveness,
muscle tone, and breathing. Normal scores are in the range of 7 and
above. A score of 4 to 6 is considered low, and lower scores
indicate a critical condition. The aim of the Apgar test is to
provide a quick index of the newborn's health, and a way of
determining whether immediate medical care is needed. The test is
quick and easy to do, and is highly predictive of the general
medical health of the infant. That is, the test has a reasonably
good validity.

#### Musical "Instruments"

In music cognition research, three tests have been important. One is
the *Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia* (MBEA) developed by
Isabelle Peretz and her colleagues. This instrument includes a
number of listening and production tasks that can be used to assess
"tone-deafness."

A second test is the *Ollen Musical Sophistication Index* (OMSI).
This instrument consists of 10 questions that are used to estimate
the degree of musical sophistication. A third test is the
*Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index* (Gold-MSI). This is a more
elaborate index for assessing musicality, is not limited to a
musician population. It involves various perceptual tasks, and
doesn't rely solely on self-report. However, the Gold-MSI index is
much longer to administer than the OSMI index.

#### Ollen Musical Sophistication Index

In music-related experiments, it is common for researchers to
distinguish "musicians" from "non-musicians." Of course, there is no
clear dividing line between musicians and non-musicians. However, it
is often useful to operationally define these in order to pursue the
research. Two of the most commonly used criteria are *number of
years of private music lessons* and *music major versus non-music
major.* These are serviceable criteria, but Joy Ollen was eager to
produce a more refined instrument that could be quicky administered
in the context of typical music-related research.

Ollen first carried out a literature review --- identify the kinds
of criteria used by researchers for distinguishing the level of
musical sophistication. She identified 743 published music studies
and found 38 different indicators used to determine degree of
musicality.

Ollen then carried out a survey of 27 experienced musicians and
asked them what sorts of questions they might ask to determine how
musically sophisticated an individual might be. These musicians
identified many of the same 38 criteria found in the published
studies, but they also added four new criteria.

Ollen distilled the 42 criteria to the most promising 29 criteria.
She then developed a 36-item questionnaire which asked such as
questions as the number of years of private musical instruction,
whether the individual had taken college-level music courses, the
number of hours per week in musical practice, and so on.

She then administered this questionnaire to 633 adults who
participated in various groups involved in music-related activities.
This ranged from members of church choirs, to members of
professional orchestras. The leader of each group (a musical expert)
was then asked to rate the musical sophistication of every member of
the group using a 10-point scale.

The data were then analyzed to determine which of the 36 questions
were most predictive of the experts' assessments of musical
sophistication. Using a logistic regression analysis, nine
indicators were identified that accounted for nearly 80% of the
variability. From this, Ollen created a 10-item questionnaire that
can be completed in under 2 minutes.

Finally, Ollen administered her instrument to a large independent
sample of people. Once again, group leaders rated the musicality of
the group members. Although the accounted variance dropped to about
50%, the results show that the OMSI instrument provides reasonably
valid estimates of musical sophistication with a minimum of effort.
