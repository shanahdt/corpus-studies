*Post Hoc* versus *A Priori*
*Exploratory* versus *Confirmatory*
*Discovery* versus *Legitimation*

1.  Philosophers of science make a distinction between the *context of
    discovery* and *context of legitimation* (e.g. Duhem, 1905).

2.  Traditionally, we don't care where an idea comes from: E.g.
    Kukel√©'s discovered the (ring) structure of benzene from a
    daydream about a snake swallowing it's tail.

3.  Traditionally, methodologists focus on the *context of
    legitimation* and ignore *context of discovery.* For traditional
    methodologists the main focus is on the truth status of some
    claim, not where the claim comes from.

4.  In recent years, social scientists have used the terms
    *exploratory* and *confirmatory* (instead of *discovery* and
    *legitimation*). The aim of exploratory research is to use
    empirical observations to formulate new theories or hypotheses.
    The aim of confirmatory research is to test a theory.

5.  Notice that theories in exploratory research emerge *post hoc*,
    whereas in testing-oriented research, the theories are *a priori*.

6.  (Huron doesn't like either of the terms "legitimation" or
    "confirmatory" since we never "legitimate" or "confirm" an idea.
    Currently, in social sciences methodology, the terms "exploratory"
    and "confirmatory" research are popular. The terms "testing" or
    "prophetic" would be appropriate instead of confirmatory. The
    terms *post hoc* and *a priori* are perhaps clearest.)

7.  Notice there are an infinite number of theories and hypotheses.
    Obviously, we can't test them all. Which should we test first? The
    order in which we address theories/hypotheses implies some
    prioritizing.

8.  It is entirely legitimate to ask why we should give priority to
    testing one theory or hypothesis over another. We should ask
    "whose" theory? "whose" hypothesis?

9.  We could well imagine that white English-speaking males have their
    own preoccupations, and so their research tends to reflect the
    concerns of white English-speaking males.

10. By way of example, Western medical research is strongly biased
    toward dealing with diseases endemic in the developed West---such
    as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. However, the most common
    debilitating disease in the world is malaria. A quarter of a
    billion people are infected with the malaria parasite each year,
    and the resulting infection is permanent.

11. We need to guard against researcher bias---not simply in how we
    observe and interpret phenomena---but also in the choice of the
    phenomena we elect to investigate.

12. While it is understandable that researchers will tend to focus on
    issues that touch them personally, there is much to be said for
    taking a broader perspective.

13. Since historically, methodologists regarded the context of
    legitimation as much more important than the context of discovery,
    it followed that *testing* or *confirmatory* research was held in
    high esteem and *exploratory* research was held in low esteem.

14. However, one of the most important functions of *exploratory
    research* is to alert us to new phenomena, different ways of
    thinking about a phenomenon, and ultimately promising theories and
    hypotheses.

15. Non-quantitative research methods like reconnissance, descriptive,
    ethnographic fieldwork, etc. offer important tools for reducing
    egocentric bias related to theories and hypotheses. The medical
    researcher who casts a wide net is more likely to recognize the
    importance of malaria---even if the researcher has never
    encountered a person who suffers from malaria.

16. So here is Huron's interpretation of the argument between
    quantitative and qualitative research: We have something to learn
    from both qualitative and quantitative approaches. As
    traditionally practised, both approaches have their blind spots.
    
    Quantitative research:

    (i) Research driven solely by *a priori* hypothesis testing
    can **blind** researchers **to novel insights and
    relationships** which await discovery by vigilant observers.
    Quantitative research doesn't pay sufficient attention to the
    creative discovery of new ideas.
    
    (ii) Constant reliance on a strictly quantitative approach **can
    lead researchers to become poor observers.**
    
    (iii) Rarely recognizes the existence of egocentric **bias in
    the choice of hypotheses or theories to test.**
    
    (iv) Finally, things that are difficult to measure are in danger
    of being ignored, or lead to claims that they don't exist.
    (This is known as the **positivist fallacy,** which we'll
    discuss further later).

    Qualitative research:

    (i) Tends to ignore hypothesis testing so the **conclusions
    are less reliable**.
    
    (ii) **Double-use data is rampant** in qualitative research.
    
    (iii) Since most qualitative research doesn't invite failure,
    **researchers tend to become overconfident** (they are never
    wrong). Because the researcher is never wrong, the researcher
    tends to place excessive trust in his/her intuitions.

17. We need both approaches: exploratory methods to expand our
    horizons and alert us to ideas or phenomena we haven't considered,
    and testing-prophetic methods to keep us honest and humble.

18. There is room for a "division-of-labors" approach, where one group
    of researchers specialize in exploratory research (generating lots
    of interesting ideas and theories to be tested), while a second
    group of researchers engage in solely confirmatory research (where
    ideas are formally tested). In fact, this division of labors is
    evident in modern physics. However, it is probably better that
    researchers are trained and become experienced in both approaches.
    Each approach helps empower the researcher to do good things.
