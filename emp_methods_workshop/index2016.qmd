# Methods in Empirical Music Research A Workshop for Music Scholars

ADVICE: From past experience, DAY 4 and DAY 5 are now the weakest. The
highlight of DAY 4 is "Writing The Paper First."

Apart from the breaks, it may be useful to have a 5th-inning stretch
from time-to-time.

DAY 3 (Statistics) is now in pretty good shape --- although it is
essential to review the material thoroughly before teaching. With regard
to statistics, there are four tasks awaiting. First, I need to add a
powerpoint/handout on measuring variance. Second, I need to add
z-scores/standard scores. This can be illustrated by my work on the
interval "preference" in J.S. Bach. Third, I really ought to have a
section on measuring effect size. Measuring Cohen's d is very
straightfoward. There is a very nice website with an excellent dynamic
demonstration at: http://rpsychologist.com/d3/cohend/ Moreover, a
segment on measuring variance would set the stage for measuring Cohen's
d. Fourth, I need to complete my handout on "Some advanced statistics
(Introduction)."

DAY 5: Running subjects can be excessively slow if there are a lot of
participants. Next time, consider running subjects in the Ethno Lab and
504 so things move more quickly. On DAY 5, it is appropriate to have
lunch with the participants. On DAY 5, one of the students brought
cookies (home-baked snacks). I should do that on DAY 5 --- was well
appreciated on the final day. On DAY 5, I stayed until 6PM to converse
with participants. People really appreciated that.
