[GROUP TASK #2:]{.small} Question, Theory, Conjecture or Hypothesis

[ANSWERS / DISCUSSION]{.small}

Identify whether the following statements are *questions, theories,
conjectures, hypotheses* or *none.*

1.  Why do performers tend to slow down at the ends of phrases?

    This is a question.

2.  Beethoven's metronome markings are too fast because his metronome
    was broken.

    This is a theory: it proposes a causal explanation. Note the use
    of the word "because." (A common mistake is to think that
    "theories" make big or sweeping generalizations; theories can be
    small and focus on minor phenomena.)

3.  Much of the popularity of World Music is due to commercial
    exploitation.

    This is a theory: it proposes a causal explanation --- although
    the mechanism of influence ("commercial exploitation") may be a
    bit vague. Note the use of the phrase "due to".

4.  How is it that listening to music can sometimes cause shivers to
    run up-and-down your spine?

    This is a question.

5.  The language we use shapes the way we think.

    Note that the word "shapes" could be replaced by synonyms such
    as "affects" or "influences." In effect, the claim is that
    language "causes" us to think differently. Consequently, it is
    appropriate to regard this as a theory.

6.  Brahms uses a lot of hemiolas in his music.

    This is a hypothesis. It is easily tested.

7.  Brahms liked hemiolas.

    Unless Brahms wrote a letter or otherwise communicated that he
    "likes" (or dislikes) hemiolas, it would be difficult or
    impossible to determine what he "likes." Consequently, it is
    better to call this a *conjecture* rather than a *hypothesis*.

8.  Africans have a better sense of rhythm than Europeans.

    If you think "sense of rhythm" is not possible to measure, then
    this is a conjecture. Otherwise it is a hypothesis.

9.  The music of Carl Nielsen echoes the spirit of the Danish people.

    As written, this statement admits several different
    interpretations. It is often helpful to try re-writing a
    statement in order to gain some clarity. For example, we might
    re-write this statement as follows: "The Danish spirit is echoed
    in the music of Carl Nielsen." This suggests that *being Danish
    influenced Nielsen's music*. Formulated this way, the statement
    would be regarded as a theory.

10. "Music hath charms to soothe the savage breast."

    (Quote from William Congreve, 1697). This is a conjecture or
    hypothesis.

11. Raag Shree sounds sad to experienced Indian listeners.

    This is a hypothesis. In principle, this claim could be easily
    tested.

12. The music of the Lakota has been influential primarily because of
    frequent portrayals of Plains Indians in Hollywood films.

    This is a theory: it proposes a causal explanation for the
    widespread influence of Lakota music. Note the use of the word
    "because."

13. The purpose of our research is to study the relationship between
    music and ritual.

    This is not a question.
    
    It is not a theory since no *cause* is proposed.
    
    It could be construed as a conjecture or hypothesis if there
    were some doubt about the purpose of the research (say, if two
    collaborators were arguing about what they are doing). E.g.
    
    Researcher 1: The purpose of our research is ... music and
    ritual.
    Researcher 2: No, no, the purpose of our research is ...
    music and dance.
    
    But this is a stretch.
    
    The best answer is "none."
    
    Notice that, as a research *goal*, it would be much better to
    say "The purpose of our research is to *understand* the
    relationship between music and ritual." The "study" of something
    may be a reasonable goal for a student, but not for a
    researcher.
