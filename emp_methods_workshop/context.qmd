## Some Thoughts About Context


One of the principal tenets of qualitative methodology has been the
importance of understanding a phenomenon ***in context***. From the
perspective of qualitative research, quantitative research methods
unduly ignore context. Quantitative research tends to treat context
as an extraneous variable whose effects need to be
controlled---either by holding the contextual effects constant, or
by randomizing. By explicitly ignoring context, researchers may
inadvertently exclude the most important factor pertaining to the
phenomenon they are studying.

![](Images/Golliwog_Debussy.jpg){width="400"} A simple (and
well-known) illustration of the role of context is found in Claude
Debussy's "Golliwog's Cakewalk" from the *Children's Corner* suite.
The initial motive is a direct quote of the love-death leitmotif
from Wagner's *Tristan und Isolde* opera. Here, Debussy offers a
parody of the "seriousness" of Wagner's music. Music is not just
sequences of sounds. Music reaches into the broader realm of social
meaning, cultural reference, and political expression.

Scholars are right to draw attention to the importance of context.
However, there are common misconceptions regarding context, the
concept of holism, and the complexity of theories.

#### What Do We Mean by "Context?"

Tug on the smallest strand of existence, and soon you are pulling on
an enormous web of connections. When a person behaves in a certain
way, that behavior is shaped by innumerable factors---including
social norms, cultural beliefs, economic conditions, media
influences, peer and family pressures, and so on. Choices are also
shaped by historical antecedents, personal autobiographical
experience, education, gender identity and expectations, as well as
personal and social power relations.

But that's not all. Humans exist in an ecological context of flora
and fauna. We exercise power relationships over plants and animals.
We shape and are shaped by our environments, including rivers,
mountains and oceans. Our behaviors are linked to climate and
weather. Our beliefs and actions are shaped by viruses, bacteria,
plagues, and accidents. Our physiology and behavior are shaped by
the diurnal movements of the sun, and by seasons caused by the tilt
of the earth. Our movements are influenced by the force of gravity,
and by the size and structure of our bodies.

But that's not all. Behaviors are also influenced by drugs, by
physiology, neurochemistry, age, hormonal changes, immune responses,
and yes, epigenetic and genetic factors. Humans are part of a grand
ongoing experiment called *evolution by natural selection*: we are
related as brothers and sisters to every living creature on the
planet.

But that's not all. Humans are made of atoms. With the exception of
hydrogen, all of the atoms in our bodies were generated by the
nuclear reactions of stars, and these atoms were dispersed into the
universe because of the gargantuan explosions known as supernovas.
Our bodies are literally constructed from stardust. We are
intimately connected to the cosmos in ways that medieval astrologers
would have found breathtaking. Once again, tug on the smallest
strand of existence, and soon you are pulling on an enormous web of
connections.

The problem with the use of the word "context" is that researchers
hold specific preconceptions about what counts as an appropriate
context. In practice, researchers who favor exclusively qualitative
methods have tended to use the word "context" to mean "social,
cultural or political context." Among self-professed qualitative
researchers, context rarely means ecological, nutritional,
geographical, neurological, economic, or evolutionary context.

Political and social scholarship encourages us to ask the question
*Whose context?* Who decides what counts as legitimate contextual
considerations for some phenomenon? Historically, both qualitative
and quantitative researchers limit the context of their research.
Researchers simply make different assumptions about which contexts
might be germane. In short, the argument really isn't about whether
or not a researcher is sensitive to context. The argument pertains
to which contexts are favored.

It is true that, in the past, many quantitative researchers have
limited their research by controlling (i.e., discounting) the
potential effects of social, cultural or political factors. But it
is equally true that, in the past, most qualitative researchers have
failed to consider other contexts that may play important roles in
the phenomena they describe (including music). In the same way that
we can't assume all phenomena trace back to neuroanatomy, we can't
assume that all phenomena trace back to political class structure.
The amount of context that's pertinent to any given phenomenon is an
empirical question. We simply have to do the research if we want to
know whether (say) culturally-defined gender roles are more
pertinent than (say) hormones levels for some specific behavioral
phenomenon.

#### Is Holism a Method?

There are similar problems with the notion of a "whole." When is our
description unduly narrow, and when is our description sufficiently
holistic? The point is well made by the anthropologist, Victor De
Munck:

"The point is that most wholes are also parts of larger wholes and
are, in part, shaped by those larger wholes, so that any rigorous
distinction between holism (usually privileged in anthropology)
and reductionism (usually scorned) is absolutely false."

-Victor De Munck (2009).

Once again, in research, reductionism is a strategy for discovery,
not a belief about how the world is. Researchers simplify problems,
not because they believe problems to be simple, but because they
believe problems to be complex. We cannot explain the whole world at
once---and we should not even try. In research, we isolate portions
of the complex web of existence, merely as a way of helping us to
glimpse some of the relationships. Aiming for a holistic
understanding is the ultimate goal; but holism is a goal not a
method. Inevitably, as researchers, we must all narrow our fields of
vision, simply because we have no better alternative for
understanding the world.

#### Simple and Complex Theories

Often, discussions of reductionism versus holism are really about
the complexity of theories. Simple theories have a limited range.
Theories that are sensitive to many contexts will necessarily be
more complex. Unfortunately, there is a price to pay for complex
theories that involve many component parts.

Self-confident individuals can certainly offer sweeping
interpretations about complex events in the world. But often these
sweeping interpretive frameworks are unfalsifiable---they don't
invite the world to tell us that the interpretations are wrong.
Preempting the possibility of failure is antithetical to the
intellectual humility that is essential for good research.

#### Summary

By way of summary:

1.  *Context is important,* and researchers should always aim to
    contextualize their work. However, there is more than one
    context. For example, *dancing* is surely influenced by
    historical context; but dancing is also influenced by the
    biomechanics of bodily movement. The researcher who focuses on
    the historical context of dancing is not "more context
    sensitive" than the researcher who focuses on the context of
    human kinematics. We won't know which context has a greater
    influence on dancing until both scholars do their research.
2.  *Reductionism is a method, not a goal.* We simplify problems,
    not because the problems are simple, but because focusing on a
    part of the problem is a helpful strategy for discovery.
3.  *Holism is a goal, not a method.* We'd like to achieve an
    integrated account that embraces all of the pertinent contextual
    factors. But the methodology of reductionism is the best method
    we have for getting there.
4.  *Complex theories are difficult (often impossible) to falsify.*
    Complicated theories go contrary to the self-correcting dynamic
    of good research. It's not helpful to start with a complicated
    theory---not because the theory may be wrong, but because it is
    difficult to show wrong complex theories to be wrong.
