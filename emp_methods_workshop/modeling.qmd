## Modeling - The B-flat Valve Trumpet

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recall that a model is miniature world that attempts to emulate
something about the real world. In meteorology, models are used to
forecast the weather or climate. In music, an example of a modeling
study is found in the work of Huron & Berec (2009) who built a model
of the trumpet-performer interaction. They then applied this model
to an analysis of various trumpet works.

#### Overview

The immediate goal of the model was to provide a measure of
*performance difficulty* for any notated score when played on the
B-flat valve trumpet. The input to the model consists of a notated
musical passage or complete score. The output is a series of
estimates of the difficulty of playing the score on the trumpet.

The model produces 10 difficulty estimates. For example, one of the
estimates it produces is the *average breathing difficulty.* The
model treats the lungs as a reservoir that may be depleted at
various rates, and refilled when opportunities arise. Notes deplete
the air supply in proportion to their durations. These rates depend
on the dynamic level and register. For example, tones in the highest
and lowest registers exhaust the air supply faster. In addition, the
air supply is more quickly depleted at louder dynamic levels. The
model assumes that the performer begins with full lungs and takes
breaths whenever a rest period greater than 0.25 seconds occurs, or
whenever an explicit breath mark is notated in the score. It takes
about 1.3 seconds to fully inhale, so the amount of replenishment
depends on the duration of the rest periods. The average breathing
difficulty is calculated so that it depends on the average volume of
air found in the player's lungs over the course of the work. If the
performer's lungs are perpetually near "empty" then the difficulty
score rises.

Apart from the average volume of air, the model is vigilant for
places where the performer completely runs out of air. This doesn't
occur often in music, but it can occur for especially difficult
works. The model keeps a tally of these "out-of-breath" instances.

Other estimates of difficulty are calculated for *average tonguing
difficulty, average embouchure difficulty, average fingering
difficulty, average dynamic difficulty, average range difficulty,*
and *average interval difficulty.* Finally, the model calculates an
*overall performance difficulty*. These values are calibrated so
that the average difficulty is 1.0.

Using the model, for example, we estimated the difficulty for a
number of musical works. For example, Herbert Clarke's virtuoso work
*Stars in a Velvety Sky* produced an overall average difficulty of
1.8. But the highest estimated difficulty was for Malcolm Arnold's
*Fantasy for Trumpet* (Opus 100) with an overall average difficulty
of 2.6.

#### How We Built the Model

Our model made use of various measures we made with two trumpet
players. One was a professional and the other was an amateur
performer. We measured how long it took the performers to take a
full breath, how fast the breath was exhausted when playing at
different dynamic levels in different registers, how fast the
performer could tongue at different dynamic levels and ranges, and
so on.

In the case of fingering difficulty, we asked the performers to
judge (on a 10-point scale) the degree of difficulty for different
finger/valve combinations. The table below shows the average
difficulty for finger/valve transitions as judged by our two trumpet
players. ("0" means open position, "1" means first valve, "2-3"
means valves 2 & 3 are depressed.) The table shows, for example,
that valve 3, followed by 1-2 has an average dificult of 7.0 (out of
a maximum difficulty of 10).

#### Validation Study

Any model should be tested before you use it. How do we know that
the model does a reasonable job of predicting the difficulty of
trumpet works? In order to test the validity, we need an independent
judge of the difficulty of different musical passages. For this, we
made use of the grading system published by the Royal Conservatory
of Music of Toronto. For the trumpet, the curriculum consists of six
grades: II, IV, VI, VIII, IX and X.

Because our model was not designed to account for performance
difficulties related to musical interpretation, we limited our
selection of graded materials to trumpet studies. We assumed that
the difficulty associated with etudes would arise primarily from
technical difficulties of performance, and that interpretive
challenges would be relatively less important than is the case for
non-etude musical works. For each conservatory grade, we randomly
selected two solo etudes from the published syllabus. We then used
the model to estimate the difficulty for each study. If our model
has any validity, we ought to observe a positive correlation between
the grade level and the difficulty estimates. The results are shown
in the table below.

Although the pattern isn't perfect, we found a statistically significant
positive correlation between the grade level and the difficulty
estimates. We also found positive correlations for each of the
constitutent difficulty components, such as breathing difficulty. In
general, the results are consistent with the notion that the model has
some predictive value above chance level.

#### Application

Huron and Berec used their model as a way of demonstrating the
difference between *difficulty* and *idiomatic*. Musicians will
commonly say that such-and-such a work is "idiomatic" to the violin.
It is tempting to assume that an "idiomatic" work is a work that is
easy to perform. However, a work that is easily performed on a given
instrument is also likely to be easy to perform on other instruments
as well.

A *difficult* work may be defined as a work that places stringent
demands on the performer, such as extraordinary physical endurance,
highly refined or accurate motor skills, taxing motor coordination, or
other awkward or strenuous tasks. By *idiomatic*, we mean that, of all
the ways a given musical goal or effect may be achieved, the method
employed by the composer/musician is one of the least difficult. That
is, the effect is produced with *comparative* or *relative* ease. This
can be illustrated by examining the effect of key on performance
difficulty. Suppose we were to transpose a work through all twelve
pitch-classes, and compare the difficulty for all transpositions. If a
work had been written in the key of E major, and E major turned out to
be the most difficult of all possible keys, then it would be hard to
claim that the work has been arranged idiomatically. On the other
hand, if we found that the key of E major exhibited the lowest
possible difficulty score, then this would lend weight to the claim
that the work was created with the instrument in mind.

Figures 1 and 2 show the effect of transposition on fingering
difficulty estimates for works by Malcolm Arnold, Guillaume Balay, and
Herbert Clarke (all composers who were trumpet players). The graphs
cover a range of plus or minus one octave. The actual key of
composition is plotted in the center of the graph (0 transposition).
Notice, first all, that the fingering difficulty shows a general
tendency to fall as the work is transposed up in pitch. Brass players
will recognize that this is a simple consequence of the way the
harmonics and valves interact. As a work is transposed higher, there
is less need to use some of the more difficult finger combinations.

Superimposed on this general downward trend are local fluctuations in
difficulty depending on the particular key. With one exception, there
is a notable minimum evident at zero transposition (i.e., the original
key composition). The one exception occurs for the slow second
movement in Arnold's trumpet concerto --- a movement that has a
relatively low overall difficulty (0.96). The predominance of local
dips at zero transposition is consistent with the suggestion that the
composers explicitly chose a key that facilitates performing the work.

Figure 3, by contrast, shows the comparable results for Paul
Hindemith's *Trumpet Sonata.* Hindemith was not a trumpet player. Here
there is no clear effect of key, nor is there any notable dip
coinciding with the key chosen by Hindemith.

It bears emphasizing that measures of performance ease and measures of
instrumental idiomaticism cannot be regarded *prima facie* as indices
of compositional merit. Difficult works are not necessarily better
than easy works, and idiomatic works are not necessarily better than
unidiomatic works.
