(Comments After Learning Objectives)

Even if you have no interest in conducting formal empirical research,
my hope is that you will benefit from learning how to critically read
and evaluate any empirical study.

Apart from these explicit learning objectives, I should confess to a
personal ulterior motive.

As an undergraduate student, I learned from my music & arts professors
to use the word "empirical" as a term of derision.

Some people are surprised to learn that I did my masters thesis on the
work of Theodor Adorno --- Frankfurt School of Critical Theory.

Adorno would have regarded himself as the embodiment of the antithesis
of empiricism. And there are many modern music scholars who hold
similarly dim views of empirical scholarship.

Presumably, everyone in this room is present because of some abiding
interest in empirical research.

Encountering people of like mind is always reassuring.

But it is important to recognize that empirically-oriented music
scholars are definitely in the minority, and that much of the broader
musicological community is quite skeptical.

Some of the skepticism is *unjustified* and arises from widespread
misconceptions in the arts communities about formal empirical research
methods.

At the same time, some of the skepticism is *justified.* Some
empirically-oriented music scholars have exhibited a remarkable
naivitee in presenting their work, and other empiricists have used
insulting or intemperate language when critiquing non-empirical
scholarship.

Apart from empirically-oriented arts scholars, scientists add fuel to
the fire when they make untenable claims, or when they show a
dismissive attitude toward traditional hermenuetic and other methods
common in arts scholarship.

When it comes methodology, everyone has something to learn. There is
no discipline that has established the one true method.

I don't think we need to replace traditional music scholarship by more
empirical approaches. Mostly, I think that there are lost
opportunities to conduct better, more insightful research.

So what do I hope you get out of these five days?

It's not simply the case that I hope you'll do more rigorous,
compelling, insightful, and inspiring research. I also hope you'll act
as emmissaries --- bridging a cultural divide that shouldn't exist in
the first place, but which is harmful to fruitful dialog about how
best to conduct research --- whether we're talking about the sciences
or the arts.
