## The Size of Samples

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of sampling is to allow us to infer some property of a
population without having to examine every member of the population.
This raises the question of how big the sample should be.

Suppose we were interested in identifying the average height of
people in developed countries. Roughly a billion people live in
developed countries, so measuring everyone's height would be
impractical. How many people would we need to include in our sample
in order to produce a good estimate of the true average for this
large population?

In general, people get taller with age until around 20 years of age.
With old age, people begin to shrink. With improved nutrition, in
most developed countries people have been getting taller over time.
Measurements made between 2003 and 2006 indicate that the average
height of females (twenty years of age and older) is 1.622 meters
(around 5 ft, 4 inches). The average height of males is is 1.763
meters (around 5 ft 9.5 inches).

There is no guarantee that every random sample will be
representative of the population. Even if we sample a thousand
people, we might, simply by chance, have sampled people who are
shorter than average, and so our estimate will be biased. This is
highly improbably, but nevertheless possible.

Roughly 95% of all people will be with plus or minus 10 cm of the
average height. For women (with a mean of 1.622 meters) this means
that 95% of all women will be between 1.522 and 1.722 cm in height.
Statisticians are able to determine the likely error for any given
sample size. The graph below shows the effect of sample size for
estimates of average height. For a sample consisting of just one
person, 95% of the time, that person will be within about 10 cm of
the true average. If your sample consists of two randomly selected
individuals, 95% of the time, the average of these two individuals
will be within about 6.6 centimeters of the true average. With a
sample of five individuals, 95% of the time, the average of this
sample will be within about 2.5 centimeters of the population
average. With a sample of twenty people, 95% of the time, the sample
average will be within about half a centimeter of the population
mean. With a sample of 100 people, 95% of the time, the sample
average will be less than 25 millimeters of the population mean.

Note that these values assume that the sampling is truly random. It
assumes that any given person in the world is as likely to be
sampled as any other person.

#### The Law of Large Numbers

The *law of large numbers* simply states that as the sample size
increases, the sample is more likely to provide a more accurate
estimate of the true population value.

A fair coin should be equally likely to appear heads or tails. That
is, it should appear heads 50% of the time. If you flip a fair coin
just once, it will either come up heads 100% of the time or 0% of
the time. If you flip a fair coin twice, it will either come up
heads 100% of the time, 0% of the time, or 50% of the time. In fact,
it will come up heads 50% twice as often as either 100% or 0%. The
greater the number of times you flip a coin, the greater the
likelihood that the number of times it appears heads will approach
the fair value of 50%. That is, the more times you sample the coin's
behavior, the greater the likelihood that the sample value will
approach the true population value.

At this point, we can introduce some useful terminology.

The average (or mean) for the population is represented by the
lower-case Greek letter *mu* (μ).

The average or mean for the sample is represented by the value x
with a horizontal bar placed on top (x̄). When spoken, this symbol is
referred to as "x-bar." Sometimes the population mean is represented
by the uppercase letter "M."

The number of items in a sample is typically represented by the
italicized uppercase letter *N*. The italicized lowercase letter *n*
is sometimes used to identify the number of cases in some sample.
For example, twenty-five people were recruited for an experiment
(*N*=25); each participant responded to 10 musical works resulting
in 250 data points (*n*=250).

In statistical calculations, we are always interested in the number
of ways that values are free to vary. This concept is referred to as
the *degrees of freedom* (abbreviated *df*). Typically, the degrees
of freedom are related to the number of observations made. So as the
sample size increases, normally the degrees of freedom also
increase.
