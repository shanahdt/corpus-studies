### Types of Behaviors

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recall that empirical knowledge is knowledge gained through
observation. When we carry out research involving people, what we
observe are various kinds of behaviors.

For convenience, it's helpful to conceptually distinguish six types
of behaviors: gross behaviors, social behaviors, topical behaviors,
metabolic behaviors, self-report behaviors, and artifactual
behaviors. As we'll see, some behaviors straddle more than one of
these six categories, so these aren't hard-and-fast distinctions.
However, they're still helpful ways of organizing observations.

#### 1. Gross Behaviors

Gross behaviors are those behaviors that involve externally
observable actions. Examples of gross behaviors include bobbing your
head, swaying, blinking, humming, singing, talking, shouting, and
laughing. Two of the most common gross behaviors evident in Western
culture including clapping hands and tapping feet. Gross behaviors
can also involve aspects of posture, such as slumping, or leaning,
lowering your head, or sitting upright. Gross behaviors also include
facial expressions, such as frowning, raising or lowering your
eyebrows, sneering, pouting, and so on.

![](Images/motion_capture2.jpg){width="220"} In the case of
performers, there are many other forms of gross behaviors to
observe. When playing a musical instrument, performers move theirs
arms, wiggle their fingers, blow air through their mouths, and so
on. Collecting information about these behaviors is often
facilitated through the use of special instrumentation, such as
motion capture devices, or by recording MIDI data.

![](Images/air_guitar.jpg){width="220"} Performance-related gestures
don't need to be real: listeners often engage in imitative gestures.
A classic example is the movements involved in "air guitar." Another
example is imaginary conducting. There are even formal competitions
for would-be air guitarists and would-be conductors. In general,
gross behaviors can be captured through photographs, through video
and audio recording, or simply by live, on-site observation.

Gross behaviors can also include what might be thought of as static
stateS rather than dynamic actions. For example, a research project
might rely on observations of a person's height, or weight, body
shape, or hair style. A study concerning reggae, for example, might
focus on whether listeners tend to have dreadlocks.

![](Images/music_tatoo.jpg){width="220"} Pertinent information for a
research project might include observations of music-related
ornaments such as jewelry, or certain kinds of clothing. There are
even people who sport music-related tattoos. A research project
related to musical style, for example, might aim to observe the make
of automobiles people drive to a concert. All of these might be
regarded as gross behaviors --- or at least gross measures.

An interesting example of the use of gross behaviors in a music
study is the work of Olaf Post. The famous Concertgebouw concert
hall in Amsterdam maintains a library of video-footage of all the
concerts that take place. One of the unique features of the
Concertgebouw is that there are several rows of seats behind the
stage. So the video recordings capture --- not just what's going on
on-stage --- but also the behavior of (at least) some of the
audience members.

Now when people attend a symphony concert, they tend to just sit and
occasionally applaud. But in fact, people (from time-to-time) cross
their legs, or scratch their noses --- adjust their glasses, turn
their heads, fold their arms --- in short, people in the audience
figet.

Using the video recordings, Olaf Post counted the number of
figetting events over the course of different performances. He found
that the amount of figetting parallels the musical structure in a
variety of ways. What's especially remarkable is that Post found
that audiences were significantly less figety when listening to
music by Gustav Mahler, compared with a composer like Anton
Bruckner.

The important point is that --- even the systematic observation of
figetting carries information that can be potentially useful in
music-related research.

#### 2. Social Behaviors

When behaviors involve groups of people, the social element becomes
foremost. Many social behaviors are really types of gross behaviors,
but when the behaviors relate to how people interact it's more
common to speak of social behaviors.

The actions of crowds at a concert may include dancing, group
clapping, swaying, arm-waving, kneeling, shouting, singing or
chanting in unison, and so on. Group movements may be synchronous or
asynchronous. Interpersonal gross behaviors may include conversing,
holding hands, winking, and other interpersonal actions.
![](Images/audience_behavior.jpg){width="220"}

Social behaviors include body language such as making eye contact,
nodding in agreement, orienting toward or away from someone, and
smiling or frowning. Since facial expressions are normally intended
to be communicative, one might want to regard all facial expressions
as social behaviors rather than gross behaviors.

Social behaviors also include networking information. On Facebook,
for example, social networks are evident in the patterns of "likes."
Social networks are also evident in e-mail contact lists, in stored
phone numbers, subscription lists, and so on.

In recent years, important research on the social aspects of music
have been carried out using large amounts of data collected through
popular web services such as Youtube, Hulu, i-Store, and Amazon. We
know, for example, that how people evaluate music is strongly
influenced by how other people evaluate music within a perceived
social group. For example Matthew Salganik and his colleagues split
14 thousand people on the world-wide web into eight randomly
assigned social groups. They showed that the popularity of new
(never heard-before) pop songs depended primarily on the mutual
awareness of what other people in the social group were listening
to. All eight social groups started off with the identical roster of
new songs, but they diverged in their musical preferences simply
through the happenstance of social influence.

#### 3. Topical Behaviors

In science, the word topical means "pertaining to the surface." A
"topical medicine" is a medicine that is applied to the skin. Hence,
topical behaviors are behaviors that relate in some way to the skin.
There are four classic topical measures: skin temperature, skin
conductance, pilomotor activity, and electromyographic responses.

Skin temperature changes slowly and can be measured with a topical
thermometer. Some parts of the body tend to be warmer than others,
and the distribution of heat can change over time. Skin temperature
can also be imaged using an infrared camera. Skin temperature is
determined principally by the amount of blood flowing near the
surface of the skin. Some changes of blood flow can be seen directly
--- such as when a person blushes or when they go pale. But most
changes are more subtle --- although they can still be measured.
When a performer is suffering from stage-fright, their hands and
feet will tend to become cold. This occurs because of the
constriction of blood vessels in the body's extremeties. This
phenomenon is referred to as peripheral vaso-constriction.

A second topical measure relates to how much we sweat. The skin is
covered with sweat glands, and the amount of sweating can change
rapidly. Sweat is a fluid with a high salt content, which means that
it's a relatively good conductor of electricity. Two electrodes are
placed on the skin, and a small (unnoticeable) voltage is applied
continuously. When sweating increases, the resistance of the skin
drops and so the electrical current increases.

These changes can be quite rapid (on the order of half a second or
so) and are easily (and cheaply) recorded. Measures of skin
conductance are variously referred to as galvanic skin response
(which is abbreviated GSR) or as skin conductance response (which is
abbreviated SCR). Skin conductance is widely used in polygraphs ---
that is, in lie detectors. Sweating increases rapidly when the
sympathetic nervous system is active. This includes experiences of
fear, the startle response, the defense reflex, the orienting
response, feelings of anger, and sexual arousal.

![](Images/goosebumps.jpg){width="300"} A third topical response
involves body hair. hair follicles can flex or relax. When the
follicles flex the skin takes on a distinctive goose-bump texture.
The technical name for this is the pilomotor response. This response
is musically important in the phenomenon of frisson where a listener
experiences "chills" or "thrills." With the help of a video camera
and a close-up lense, the pilo-motor response can be observed
visually. We simply point the camera at the back of the neck or the
arm of a participant. Looking at the camera output, an observer can
then visually characterize the degree to which the skin takes on a
gooseflesh appearance.

![](Images/EMG.jpg){width="220"} A fourth topical measure arises
from the muscles underneath the skin. Muscles produce electrical
potentials that can be measured. These measures are referred to as
*electromyography* (abbreviated EMG). EMG potentials can be measured
either at the surface of the skin, or more directly by inserting a
small needle or electrode into the muscle. Muscles generate large
electrical potentials when they're flexed, but they also produce
spontaneous electrical activity when at rest. The resulting muscle
activity can be highly informative depending on the muscle being
monitored. For example, facial muscles echo various emotional
states. By way of example, EMG activity in the zygomatic muscles
(involved in smiling) provides a good indication of positive
feelings --- even if there's no visible evidence of smiling. An
example of the use of EMG in music research is in the work of Ulf
Dimberg who has demonstrated that EMG activity provides a useful
measure of the perceived pleasantness or unpleasantness of a sound.

A particularly illuminating set of muscles are those related to the
eyes. We can identify three main aspects to eye behavior. The
simplest is blinking --- which is one of the most reliable
indicators of the startle response. When you hear a loud unexpected
sound, it's very likely that you'll blink. A second aspect is the
size of your pupils. The dark region at the center of the eye
responds very quickly and continuously to changes of stimulation,
including sounds. A third aspect is the movement of the eyes
themselves --- known as saccadic movements.

John Sloboda has carried out studies examining how the eyes move
when musicians read musical notation. It turns out that the
movements of the eyes differ depending on whether the music is
predominantly homophonic or predominantly polyphonic. There are also
observable differences between how the eyes move for highly trained
musicians versus less experienced musicians reading musical scores.

Notice that eye behaviors form a special category that might be
regarded as either gross behaviors or as topical behaviors.

#### 4. Metabolic Behaviors

Metabolic behaviors relate to body conditions under the skin's
surface. Classic examples of metabolic behaviors include heart-rate,
blood pressure, (core) body temperature, and respiration.

Of course many metabolic observations can be measured from the
body's surface. For example, we can measure a person's pulse simply
by pressing a couple of fingers against their wrist. Or we can
measure blood pressure using a cuff wrapped around a person's arm
--- and so on. There's certainly room to debate whether these should
be categorized as metabolic or topical measures. Nevertheless,
traditionally, heart rate and blood pressure are considered
metabolic measures.

Pulse can be measured with wrist-watch like devices that can collect
data continuously over many hours or even days. Two classic heart
responses are of particular interest: the *tachycardic* and
*bradycardic* responses. A tachycardic response occurs when the
heart-rate increases briefly and then returns to normal. This is
associated with fear or alarm. A bradycardic response occurs when
the heart-rate decreases briefly, rebounds above normal briefly, and
then returns to normal. This is associated with interest or
attentiveness.

Another measure of interest is the heart-rate variability (or HRV).
This has been found to be especially informative in a variety of
different ways.

![](Images/oximeter.jpg){width="220"} Another metabolic behavior is
breathing or respiration. Respiration can be measured using a
string-like or band-like device that's placed snugly around a
participant's chest. It can also be measured using an electronic
device taped to a person's chest. Breathing influences the amount of
oxygen in the body. Rather than measuring respiration, there exists
a simple device (an oximeter) that clips onto the finger --- and can
be used measure more directly the oxygen level in the blood.

![](Images/EEG.jpg){width="220"} One of the most useful
physiological measures is the electrical activity generated by the
brain. Eletroencephalography (or EEG) measures tiny changes of
voltage that reflect the electrical activity of large groups of
neurons. Although these voltages are very small, they can still be
measured by placing electrodes on a person's scalp. EEG measures are
rather crude --- representing the average activity of assemblies of
millions of neurons. When enough neurons fire at roughly the same
time, they create a big-enough electrical potential to be measured
at the surface of the head.

In music-related research, it's most common to look at the
electrical activity that's evoked in response to a particular sound.
These are so-called event-related potentials (abbreviated ERPs).
ERPs have characteristic signatures that can indicate, for example,
whether a person noticed or paid attention to a given sound. These
signatures have proved particularly useful in answering questions
about what infants are able to hear or distinguish. For example,
research by Laurel Trainor and her colleagues has determined when
infants are able to recognize atonal violations of tonal melodies.
Infants can't talk about what they hear, but their EEG responses can
give important clues about how they're experiencing the sounds.

An important class of metabolic measures is to be found in hormone
levels. Hormones are chemical messengers, commonly transported by
the blood that influence cell behavior in many ways. Examples of
hormones include epinephrine and norepinephrine (also known as
adrenaline and noradrenaine), dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin,
prolactin, cortisol, histamine, estrogen, testosterone, insulin, as
as others. Some of these hormones (like testosterone) can be
measured in saliva. So we can have a participant simply spit into a
small cup, or use a mouth swab. Another common technique has the
participant chew on a small absorptive plastic device.

Other hormones can be measured only by taking a blood sample.
Depending on the sensitivity of the assay method, the researcher may
need only a small dab of blood (that can be collected from a
pin-prick), or a larger sample of blood that would require a
professional nurse to do a blood-draw.

Some hormones are present only in the brain. Unfortunately, these
hormones can be measured only by examining the cerebro-spinal fluid
--- which is gathered through a spinal tap. This procedure is much
too invasive to be used for casual research purposes, like studying
music.

An example of observing changing hormone levels in response to music
is the work of Hajime Fukui who found that testosterone levels are
lower when people listener to their preferred music.

![](Images/MRI_scanner.jpg){width="250"} In the past decade, it's
become increasingly common to use brain scanners in music research.
At least four types of scanners can be distinguished. Functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (or fMRI) can be used to measure how much
oxygen is being used in different parts of the brain. Areas of the
brain that are the most active use more oxygen. The localized blood
volume in that area changes rapidly, and fMRI methods can be used to
pin-point these places when a person is engaged in different tasks.
MRI machines are noisy --- producing a loud intermittent banging
sound that limits their use in auditory tasks. The machines are
bulky and expensive.

Positron Emission Tomography (or PET) involves the injection of
mildly radio-active substances into the blood-stream. Depending on
the substance that is injected, PET can provide very useful
indications of where in the brain a particular neurochemical is
released or congregates. Using this technique, for example, Varlery
Salipoor and her colleagues were able to show that listening to
chill-inducing music released dopamine in regions of the brain
associated with the experience of pleasure. PET is quite invasive
since participants are injected with radio-active substances. The
preparation of these materials by an experienced chemist makes PET
especially expensive.

![](Images/MEG_scanner.jpg){width="250"} A third technique is
MagnetoEncephalography (or MEG). Like EEG, this method traces the
electrical activity of the brain. However, it monitors magnetic
information rather than voltage --- giving much better resolution
and is able to provide better information about activity going-on
deeper in the brain. Compared with fMRI and PET, MEG has an
especially good temporal resolution, resolving electrical events in
the brain with a precision around 10 milliseconds. Since MEG
scanners measure magnetic fields, the scanning must take place in a
magnetically shielded room. In addition, liquid helium is used to
cool the machine, which raises the cost significantly.

A fourth method is functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (or fNIRS).
Infrared light is able to penetrate through the scalp and skull, and
for some distance into the cortex. The reflected light is useful for
detecting changes in blood hemoglobin. Like fMRI, fNIRS can be used
to infer oxygen uptake in regions of the brain associated with
neural activity. In addition, NIRS is much more portable than fMRI,
PET, or MEG machines. Some manufacturers provide wireless
instruments that allow researchers to study freely moving people.
However, due to the absorption of light, NIRS can only be used to
scan the outer cortical tissues of the brain. It is unable to
measure subcortical structures. NIRS is especially effective for
imaging the brains of infants. The technique is non-invasive, and
the thin skulls of infants allows the light to penetrate more deeply
into the neural tissue.




#### 5. Self-Report

Without question, the most common behaviors used in research is the
self-report. Self-report is the label given to any behavior in which
we simply ask participants something. An obvious example of a
self-report is when we ask someone to indicate their age on a
questionnaire. In these cases, we rely on special knowledge
possessed by the participant.

Self-report observations can be collected in many ways, including
both formal and informal interviews. For example, we might ask a
child what songs she knows, how long she's been studying an
instrument, or what she thinks of her music teacher.

Questionnaires and surveys all involve self-report. These can be
done with pencil and paper, through brief interviews, or using
electronic media such as having people answer questions via the web.

![](Images/written_test.jpg){width="200"} Many self-report behaviors
involve asking someone to offer an opinion. IQ tests and personality
tests --- all rely on self-report. Often responses are structured,
so that the participant simply selects one of a set of predefined
answers. For example, a statement may be presented, and the
participant is asked to indicate the degree to which they agree with
it: strongly-agree, agree, agree somewhat, undecided, disagree
somewhat, disagree, or strongly disagree. In music, it's common to
ask which of two sounds is more dissonant, or more memorable, or
more whatever.

These are referred to as forced-choice responses. If only two
choices are provided, the mode of responses is commonly known as a
two alternative forced choice --- which is frequently abbreviated
2AFC. Responses might involve typing on a computer,
pointing-and-clicking, or pressing a button of some sort.

Self-reports include elicited statements and introspective reports
--- such as asking a performer to describe (for example) how he or
she begins practising a new musical work.

Apart from interviews, conversations, surveys or questionnaires,
responding by pressing a button is also typically regarded as a form
of self-report.

Self-report is commonly used in research, even when there are more
objective methods available. For example, rather than asking a
person their age, we might follow-up by using government records to
obtain a copy of their birth certificate. But in the majority of
studies, the researcher has little reason to doubt the accuracy of
the information provided by the participant.

Nevertheless, there are common situations where participants do not
accurately self-report. For example, in self-report, people often
claim to be taller than they are, and it's very common for people to
mis-report their weight. When accurate data is needed, the
researcher may choose to perform objective measurements.

The biggest advantage of self-reports is that they are often the
easiest kind of data to collect. However, they are also easily
confounded by the views, the ideas or the beliefs of the
participant. These beliefs may or may not be accurate. For example,
a musician might intellectually conclude that there's nothing
inherently sad about the minor chord. Our musician might even claim
that he or she doesn't hear the minor chord as having any sad
connotations. In many cases, we should simply believe what a person
says. But sometimes people deceive themselves --- and so what is
said doesn't necessarily accurately reflect what they're
experiencing.

#### Implicit Measures

In these sorts of cases it's useful to use a method in which the
person's beliefs are sidelined. One of the best ways to do this, is
by employing so-called *implicit measures.* A simple example is
provided by the *affective priming method.* Frank Ragozzine carried
out a simple experiment where he flashed words on a screen and asked
participants to respond as quickly as possible to whether the word
was a Happy word or a Sad word.

First of all, this task is easy. The words are very clearly happy or
sad. For example, sad words might include *glum, down, sorrow, blue*
and *blah*. Happy words might include *smile, jolly, pleased,
jumping* and *sunny*. The participant simply had to press one of two
buttons as quickly as possible --- either the happy-word button or
the sad-word button.

Now consider what happens when we play either a major or minor chord
immediately before the word appears on the screen. What Ragozzine
found was that playing a major chord improved the reaction speed for
happy words but reduced the speed for sad words. At the same time,
he found that playing a minor chord reduced the speed of reaction
for happy words and improved the reaction speed for sad words. In
other words, the chords facilitated performance when they conformed
to the major-happy or minor-sad conventions --- but they interferred
with performance when the didn't match the major-happy or minor-sad
conventions. What's nice about this method is that the task is
simply too fast for people to give any thought. We can test people
from different cultures and different backgrounds and see how they
respond --- without having to rely exclusively on what they say or
claim.

In general, researchers prefer these implicit observations over
explicit measures. Implicit methods reduce the impact of what a
person believes --- and instead focuses on how they behave. The most
revealing kinds of behaviors are those that are spontaneous and
unconscious. When a person taps their foot or smiles, it's likely
that they're enjoying the music --- whatever they might say.
Spontaneous and implicit measures have been used, for example, to
determine how prejudiced a person is. Few people would ever say that
they are prejudiced against people of African descent, or women or
foreigners. However, various implicit association tasks can be quite
revealing about a person's unspoken dispositions. Our actions can
betray attitudes that our conscious selves might find quite
uncomfortable.

As researchers, then, we're always on the look-out for spontaneous,
easily observable behaviors that are not strongly regulated by
conscious thought.

I recall one day, casually listening to a recording by the musical
humorist Peter Schickele --- better known as P.D.Q. Bach. It was a
live recording --- and of course there was laughter. Now
music-induced laughter isn't a common behavior. But I remember being
so struck by the behavior itself: laughter is an easily observable
behavior that's quite spontaneous and not strongly regulated by
conscious thought.

That observation led to a major study of musically-evoked laughter.
With Joy Ollen, for example, we carefully studied 640 instances of
audience laughter in response to musical jokes.

Although it might seem tangential to more commonplace musical
experiences, we learned a lot from that research.

So once again, although self-report is perhaps the most important
source of behavioral observations for studying music, there are
times when the researcher needs to be suspicious of the capacity of
participants to accurately introspect and honestly report what
they're experiencing.

A useful check on observations from self-report, is to look for
converging evidence using implicit methods where the conscious
thoughts and beliefs of the participant are sidelined.

#### 6. Artifactual Behaviors

A final category of behaviors might be called *artifactual
behaviors.* People create things: in cultures all over the world we
find all kinds of different musical instruments; musicians also make
recordings --- in lots of different formats; people make music
videos, they take photographs, they write in diaries and blogs, they
write program notes, they even write lyrics down on slips of paper.

In the case of music, some of the most important artifacts include
sound recordings and musical scores. Scores and recordings are the
familiar starting points for many forms of traditional music
scholarship --- especially the work of music theorists and scholars
doing music analysis.

When approached systematically, empirical observations rely on the
usual quantitative measures. A scholar might count the number of
instances of a certain event --- like the number of Neapolitan
chords in some corpus. Even simple counts --- like the number of
notes or the number of measures in a work can sometimes prove
useful.

![](Images/manuscript.jpg){width="220"} Historical musicologists
make use of a variety of techniques for making sense of manuscripts.
For example, paying close attention to the hand-writing in a
manuscript might help to resolve whether two manuscripts were
written by the same person, or by two different people.

It's often helpful to measure or count features as a way of helping
to resolve a question or conjecture. What is the average angle of
the stems compared with the horizontal staff. Is there a slight
leaning to the left or to the right? How long are the stems? What
kind of cursive style is used for the textual underlay --- and so
on. Tallying-up a series of physical measures from a manuscript can
help provide converging evidence for a particular historical
interpretation.

Conventionally, analysis might involve interpreting the harmonies in
a score and perhaps relating certain harmonic progressions to
different styles, genres or periods.

In recent decades, many musical scores have become available online,
and so many measurements can be automated with the assistance of
computer software.

A simple example here might be the so-called melodic arch. Musicians
long ago observed an apparent tendency for melodic phrases to rise
upward and then fall downward forming a sort of arch. Think of "My
Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean" or "Somewhere Over the Rainbow." In each
case, the phrases tend to ascend at the beginning and descend towrd
the cadence. But no sooner do you think of this --- than all kinds
of exceptions come to mind. So, for example, the song "Joy to the
World" and the American national anthem both begin high --- dropping
downward --- and then rise upward toward the end. So is there any
merit to the notion of a melodic arch?
![](Images/arch07.png){width="220"}

![](Images/arch08.png){width="220"} The three accompanying graphs
are from Huron (1996). The graphs show what happens when the pitches
for a large number of melodic phrases are averaged together. The
three graphs illustrate phrases of 7-, 8- and 9-notes in length. In
each graph, the first plotted point represents the average pitch
height (in semitones above middle C) for all the first notes in the
phrases. The second point represents the average pitch height for
the seconds notes in the phrases, and so on.

![](Images/arch09.png){width="220"} Although we can identify plenty
of individual exceptions, on average, it is indeed the case that for
many genres of Western music, the melodic arch is more than a
figment of our imaginations. In general, there is a tendency for
melodies to ascend and then descend over the course of individual
phrases.

As we've seen, there are innumerable artifacts arising from human
behavior that can be measured or tabulated. These include scores,
sound recordings, and even from musical instruments. All of these
can provide useful observations --- either for exploratory research
or for hypothesis-testing.
