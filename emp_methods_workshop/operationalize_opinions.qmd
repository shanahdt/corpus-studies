Opinions as Operationalizations

Some terms are easier to operationalize than others. It may be
straightforward to count the number of people attending a concert, but
usually some refinement of the counting procedure is necessary.
Suppose for example that you are counting "the number of notes in a
work" from a printed score. You might decide to exclude repeats signs
but include a Da Capo return. You might reasonably exclude "tied-to
noteheads," but what about groupettos and grace notes? And what about
trills and other ornaments? Some clarification will be necessary. How
you settle on an operationalization will depend on the research goal
and on the amount of labor required.

When operationalizing terms, try to anticipate the kinds of problems
that might arise, and define your terms accordingly. Even so, once the
measuring begins, you are apt to encounter situations which will
require further refinement to the operational definitions.

In some cases, it will seem impossible to define a "mechanical"
procedure that will always produce unambiguous results. In these
cases, it may be necessary to rely on *opinion.* For example, in
several studies we've done, we have contrasted works in major and
minor keys. Most of the time, musicians will have no difficulty
identifying whether a score is in the major or minor mode. There are
some difficulties, however. It is not uncommon for a minor-mode work
to modulate to the relative major for a period of time. Minor-mode
works may end with a Picardy Third (where the final tonic chord is
major). Some works don't end in the same key in which they began.
There are atonal works, whole-tone works, and works written in
medieval modes like Dorian or Phrygian. Despite these and other
complications, for common-practice period music, 9 out of 10 musicians
will agree on the key. It's not outrageous for an experimenter to
judge the key of most works. In many research projects, we've relied
on the opinion of the researcher to determine key. Since some pieces
can be ambiguous or questionable, we typically use three categories:
(1) obviously major, (2) obviously minor, and (3) not obviously major
or minor. In effect, we operationalize a work's mode as "the opinion
of the experimenter when examining the score, as to whether the work
is obviously major or obviously minor."

In other cases, it may be much less clear, and so opinion may be
easily skewed by the beliefs of the experimenter. Suppose, for
example, that an experimenter was testing the hypothesis that
"composer A wrote shorter phrases than composer B." Suppose further
that neither composer took pains to write explicit phrase markings
over every phrase. Opinions about "what's a phrase" are much less
unanimous than opinions about major or minor mode. Here, experimenter
bias is more likely to be a problem. Nevertheless, an independent
musician---not familiar with the aims of the project or the hypothesis
being tested---may prove useful. Rather than trying to create a
mechanical procedure for defining a phrase, we might simple rely on an
independent opinion. In this case, one could operationalize phrases as
"whatever an independent musician marks in the score as a phrase."

For some tasks, opinions can diverge considerably. For example,
although it is relatively easy to determine whether pieces in the 18th
century exhibit a "sonata-allegro" form, this becomes much more
contentious in music from the 19th century. If a researcher needs to
know whether a given movement is in sonata-allegro form, it may be
necessary to poll the opinions of several theorists. In thise case,
one could operationalize "in sonata-allegro form" as "those movements
that a minimum of 3 of 5 music theorists claim to conform to
sonata-allegro form."

All concepts ultimately prove to be difficult to "pin-down." In
operationally defining a term, the researcher should first aim to
produce a mechanical procedure that anyone could follow, resulting in
a clear and repeatable measurement. If that's not possible, "opinions"
can be used. In some cases, opinions are sufficiently uncontentious
that the experimenter's own opinion can be used. In order to avoid
experimenter bias, independent opinions from people unfamiliar with
the aims and hypothesis of the study might be used. It may be
necessary to recruit "experts"---so that the opinions are more
informed. If the term is especially fuzzy, the experimenter might
employ several experts, and establish a minimum criterion of
unanimity.

The important point is that opinions can provide useful
operationalizations for especially intractable terms or concepts.
