[GROUP TASK #7:]{.small} From Question to Theory to Conjecture to
Hypothesis to Protocol

#### Task

In your group, discuss the questions and theories developed by
individual members in the previous exercise ("From Question to
Theory"). Choose one of the theories and develop two or three
conjectures: *If the theory were correct, what might you expect to
observe or predict?* Choose one of your conjectures and write it as
a single sentence.

If there is time, refine your conjecture into a hypothesis. Once
again, consider two or three possibilities, before deciding on a
single one. Write your hypothesis as a single sentence, in the form
of a claim.

If there is still time, operationalize the terms in your hypothesis
so you produce a protocol.

#### Rationale

This exercise provides practice in linking high-level theorizing to
concrete empirical research procedures.
