# Brahms's Hemiolas


A common statistical tests is the chi-square test. This test takes
its name from the Greek letter *X* (pronounced "Kye" --- rhymes with
"pie"), which is used to compare ratios of counts. It facilitates
the determination of whether the number of occurrences of some
feature in one data sample is significantly greater than or less
than what would otherwise be expected.

By way of example, let us test the hypothesis that Brahms use lots
of hemiolas. Notice, first of all that "lots of hemiolas" is
ambiguous. If we count three hemiolas in a short piano work, is that
a small or big number? In order to answer that question we need a
comparison or sense of what is normal or expected. An appropriate
approach is to compare the number of hemiolas in Brahms with the
number of hemiolas in the music of his contemporaries.

So, to set up the test we need first to count (a) the number of
hemiolas in a sample of Brahms's music, and (b) the number of
hemiolas in the comparison population --- the number of hemiolas in
a similar sized sample of music by other composers who were active
at the same time. Let us suppose that the raw data looks like this:

COMPOSER(S)

MEASURES SEARCHED

HEMIOLAS FOUND

Various

5000

23

Brahms

500

9

Proportionally, hemiolas occurred in 1.8% of the data for Brahms (9 out
of 500) but just 0.7% in the music by other composers (23 out of 5000).
Is this difference within the range of what one might expect by chance?
That is, is this difference statistically significant? A chi-square test
will tell us.

[]{#Calculating Chi-Square}

#### Calculating Chi-Square

The test entails three parts. First, we draw our line in the sand.
That is, we establish in advance of our test our *confidence level.*
Let us use a conventional confidence level of 95 percent. This
corresponds to a significance level of .05. Second, we calculate the
value of chi-squared. This is done by subtracting the number of
expected occurrences from the number of observed occurrences, squaring
the result, and dividing it by the number of expected occurrences.
Where *O* is the observed number of occurrences and *E* is the
expected number, the formula is:

The summation symbol means that we must perform the calculation for
each expected element. There are two elements to the expectation: how
many measures we expect to contain a hemiola, and how many measures we
would expect *not* to contain a hemiola. If we would normally expect
23 hemiolas in 5000 measures of music of the period, then we would
expect about 2.3 hemiolas in the 500 measures of Brahms's music, i.e.,
that *E~1~* = 2.3. At the same time, in our sample of various
composers we observed that 4977 measures of music (out of 5000) did
not contain a hemiola. If Brahms was like other composers, we would
expect 497.7 of the 500 measures *not* to contain a hemiola.
Accordingly, *E~2~* = 497.7. The actual number of hemiolas encountered
was in his music was 9, and the actual number of non-hemiolas measures
was 491. So the numeric substitutions would be as follows:

Our value of chi-squared is 19.6.

[]{#Determining Statistical Significance}

#### Determining Statistical Significance

Now we need to determine whether our chi-squared value is
statistically significant. Recall that our confidence level is 95
percent---and that this corresponds to a significance level of .05. We
need to determine whether the chi-squared value is sufficient to
achieve statistical significance at the .05 significance level. In
order to answer this question, we will make use of a table of critical
values for chi-square. Such tables have been pre-computed by
statisticians, and are easily found in the appendices of any
statistics book or on the web.

In order to determine the critical value for chi-square, we need to
know the significance level (or confidence level) and the so-called
*degrees of freedom* (abbreviated df). For this task, there is only a
single degree of freedom. From the table below, we can see that for
the 95% confidence level (=.05 significance level), with one degree of
freedom, the critical value of chi-squared is 3.841. Our actual
calculated value of chi-squared is 19.6. This means that our result is
statistically significant. That is, the observations are not
consistent with the null hypothesis; instead, they are consistent with
our research hypothesis.

The value of *X*Â² is sensitive to the number of observations. The
greater the number of observations, the greater the likelihood that
the result will be considered significant. If a coin were flipped 6
times and came up heads 4 of them, this incidence would be considered
to lie within the realm of chance. But if the coin came up heads on
400 of 600 tosses (preserving the same proportion), the value of *p*
would be less than 0.001.

#### Tips

The chi-square test is about *counts*, not *percentages*. The values
used in the calculation must be *actual counts* and *expected counts.*
The percentages are useful, only as a way to identify the expected
counts.

The test is called *chi square* (no 'd'), but the calculated value is
referred to as *chi squared* (with the 'd').
