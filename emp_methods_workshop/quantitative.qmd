## The Quantitative/Measurement "Obsession"

#### Introduction

Another common complaint is that empirical researchers are obsessed
with numbers and measurement. To many, this quantitative
preoccupation seems contrary to the humanistic spirit.

Quantitative methods are important in empirical research for two
reasons. The first reason is that counting can help us discover
phenomena that might otherwise be invisible. The second (and more
important) reasons is that counting helps make it clear when we are
wrong. Counting and measuring are useful tools, like a magnifying
glass or a stethoscope.

First, consider how numbers can aid in discovery: consider the story
of radar imaging of the earth.

#### A Satellite Story

In the early years of the space program, NASA launched a simple
satellite that used a radar beam to image the planet's surface. The
satellite produced very accurate readings of the height (elevation)
for each point as it orbitted the earth thousands of times. The
purpose of the satellite was to help geographers produce more
accurate topographical maps of the earth.

About 3/4 of the earth's surface is covered by water, so most of the
data collected by the satellite was precise elevation measures of a
given point on the ocean as the satellite passed overhead. Since the
goal of project was to create accurate topographical maps of the
landmass, the ocean data was considered useless. Moreover, each time
the satellite passed over the same spot in the ocean, the water
level was different (because of the effects of waves and tides).

Nevertheless, some bright scientist asked, "What would happen if,
for a given point in the ocean, we averaged together all of the
elevation measures?" Repeated measures would tend to erase the
effects of the waves and tides. You might think that this would
averaging procedure result in a smooth ocean surface. But when the
researchers did this, they found that there were regions of the
ocean where the average sea level was relatively high and other
regions where the sea level was relatively low. This was how
scientists discovered *vertical currents*.

We're all familiar with horizontal currents --- lateral movements of
water, such as the "gulf stream" which moves water from the Gulf of
Mexico to northern Europe. But there are also "vertical" currents:
regions in the oceans where water is constantly welling-up from
below, or being sucked-down from the surface. The radar data allowed
researchers to see these vertical currents, and it was only possible
to "see" these currents because of averaging large amounts of
(highly variable) data. The averaging allowed the effects of waves
and tides to be eliminated.

#### Melodic Arch

In music, the value of averaged measurements is apparent in the
so-called melodic arch. Musicians have long observed an apparent
tendency for melodic phrases to rise upward and then fall downward
forming a sort of arch. Tunes like *My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean*
and *Somewhere Over the Rainbow* offer appropriate examples. In both
songs, the phrases tend to ascend at the beginning and descend
toward the cadence.

Of course, one can think of all kinds of exceptions. For example,
both *Joy to the World* and the American national anthem begin with
high initial pitches --- dropping downward and then rising upward
over the course of the phrase. So is there any merit to the notion
of a melodic arch?

The figures shown below are from Huron (1996). The graphs pertain to
samples of 7-, 8- and 9-note phrases. Almost twenty thousand musical
phrases were averaged together in order to produce these three
figures. Specifically, the first data points in each graph represent
the average pitch height (measured in semitones from middle C) for
the first notes in each phrase. The second data points represent the
average pitch for the second notes, and so on.

Although we can identify plenty of individual exceptions, on
average, the graphs are indeed consistent with the notion of a
general melodic-arch tendency --- at least in the case of some
Western music.

#### Showing You Are Wrong

In my first year as an undergraduate student, I spent time reading
some of the classic feminist writers --- including works by Betty
Friedan, Germaine Greer, Susan Brownmiller and Gloria Steinem. As a
man, I frequently felt defensive when reading these works. From
time-to-time I thought various claims were exaggerated or simply
wrong. I recall reading one passage which discussed how men tend to
dominate mixed conversations. My first response was skeptical. I'd
grown up in a society where women were regularly portrayed as
"chatterboxes" and "gossips." I personally knew a couple of women
whose monologues were perfectly capable of filling-in whatever
air-time was available.

My skepticism led me to perform what may have been my first
empirical study. One afternoon, I simply sat in a student lounge
eavesdropping on different conversations around me. With pencil and
notebook in hand, I watched the second-hand of a wall-clock, and
recorded the amount of time men and women spoke in various groups. I
also recorded the number of men and women participating in each
conversation. After an hour or so, I tallied up the results. The
numbers were sobering. In every mixed group that I monitored, men
dominated the conversation by amounts that were disproportionate to
their numbers. Despite the thousands of conversations I'd heard in
my life to that point, somehow I'd failed to notice what was obvious
to most women. The numbers in my notebook were not consistent with
the "chatterbox" image of women. The numbers told me that I had been
wrong. Ultimately, the numbers changed my attitude.

Research shows that it can be surprisingly hard to get people to
change their views. Anecdotes can be easily dismissed as "one-off"
exceptions to our beliefs. It takes constant battering with
evidence, before people will finally acknowledge that their beliefs
may be incorrect.

Although the essence of good research is to invite failure, we may
be slow to recognize failure when we see it. Numbers provide a
useful tool for defining failure. In research, the principal benefit
of quantitative methods is that they can provide compelling evidence
that you're wrong.

#### Bean Counters

Empirical researchers typically don't like being called "bean
counters" for the same reason that anthropologist don't like being
called "travel writers." It is true that anthropologists travel, and
write about the cultures they encounter. It is also true that
empirical musicologists count things. But in both cases the goal is
*understanding* and *discovery*. Counting provides a useful way for
discovering aspects about the world that might otherwise be
invisible to intuition or informal observation.

More importantly, the humble act of counting is the clearest way to
invite failure. Recall that we recognize failure by *drawing a line
in the sand.* As noted earlier, drawing a line means that we must
have some way of determining on which side of the line the
observations lie. We *count* and *measure* things as a way of
inviting failure. We count, not because of some quantitative
obsession, but because counting helps us recognize when were are
deceiving ourselves (Huron, 1999).

Counting the number of malaria parasites in a blood sample is not a
symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Nor does it arises from
some dark allegiance to the mechanical. It arises from an
understanding that intuition can often warp perception rather than
inform it, and that quantitative methods are valuable checks against
our own intellectual enthusiasms. A person who genuinely cares about
human welfare may ultimately find that his or her commitment leads
to acts such as counting the number of malaria parasites in a blood
sample. People who genuinely care about understanding music may
similarly find that their commitment leads them to acts such as
measuring the spectral centroid in a sung vowel.

At first, counting seems to represent the very antithesis of the
humanistic spirit. But the humble act of counting offers one of the
very best ways of addressing some of the most important questions in
music and culture in a way that reduces self-deception.
