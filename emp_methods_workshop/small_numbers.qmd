## The Law of Small Numbers

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are 3,141 counties in the United States. Some of these
counties have higher rates of cancer than others. The lowest cancer
rates are evident in sparsely populated rural areas, especially in
the West, Midwest, the South, and Alaska. These counties also tend
to be politically Republican. Why do you suppose these counties have
lower cancer rates?

One possibility is that these counties have less air and water
pollution, and that people in rural areas are more likely to engage
in regular physical activity. It is also possible that people in
rural areas eat a healthier diet with fewer food additives. Another
possibility is that strong religious convictions lead to cleaner
living with less drug or alcohol abuse. Perhaps the closer
friendships and community values found in rural areas tend to lower
stress. What do you think? Are these plausible explanations for the
lower cancer rates?

We might find it helpful to contrast these counties with those U.S.
counties that have the *highest* rates of cancer. The highest cancer
rates are evident in sparsely populated rural areas, especially in
the West, Midwest, the South, and Alaska. These counties also tend
to be politically Republican.

What's wrong here?

Suppose that the true normal incidence of cancer is 0.1% of the
population per year. If we have a small sample of people, our
estimates will be more variable. Small samples are likely to exhibit
rates that are potentially somewhat higher or somewhat lower, simply
because the sample size is smaller. Urban counties have more people;
in effect, they are larger sample sizes, and so the cancer rates are
more likely to approach the true population mean of 0.1% per year.
It follows that highly populated counties will have less extreme
(high or lower than normal) rates of cancer.

#### Small Samples are More Variable:

Daniel Kahneman (2012) summarizes the problem in the following way:
"you must exert some mental effort to see that the following two
statements mean exactly the same thing:

-   Large samples are more precise than small samples.
-   Small samples yield extreme results more often than large
    samples do.

The first statement has a clear ring of truth, but until the second
version makes intuitive sense, you have not truly understood the
first." (Kahneman, 2012; p.111)

People have difficulty recognizing that smaller samples are less
likely to be representative. Small samples will exhibit greater
variability, for exactly the same reason that large samples exhibit
less variability. Unfortunately, there is a tendency for people to
place too much faith in small samples.

Is a coin fair? Suppose we flipped the coin 50 times. We find that
the coin turns up heads 26 times out of 50 (i.e. 52%). But randomly
selected smaller samples of the same sequence exhibit considerably
greater variability:

This leads to our next slogan:

**Slogan:** *The law of large numbers does not apply to small
numbers.*

Expect small samples to be poorer estimates of the population
values. In particular, be careful when comparing large samples with
small samples.

#### Melodic Peaks:

Do music scholars fall prey to the "law of small numbers?"

Consider the book *HighPoints: A Study of Melodic Peaks* by the
music theorist, Zohar Eitan. Eitan's book deals with melodic peaks
or climax pitches. He analyzed the melodic high-points in a sample
of 100 musical works. On the basis of his analyses, he was able to
offer a number of general observations about peak melodic pitches.
Most of Eitan's generalizations are methodologically solid and
musically interesting. For example, peak melodic pitches are more
likely to occur toward the end of a work, are more likely to
correspond with points of harmonic tension, and tend to coincide
with the culmination of a crescendo. However, one of Eitan's
observations is problematic.

Eitan noticed that melodic peaks tend to appear uniquely (only once)
in a segment. Especially, when compared with other pitches in the
melody, the highest pitch tends to appear more rarely.

It turns out that most of the pitches in a given melody tend to
cluster in the center of the range for that melody. As you move
farther away from the average pitch, those pitches tend to occur
less frequently. Suppose we asked a group of undergraduate juniors
to state their ages. We might find that most students are 20 and 21
years old, somewhat fewer are 19 and 22 years old, and fewer yet are
18 and 23 years of age. If the oldest person in the class is 24,
what's the likelihood that someone else in the class is the same
age? We would "discover" that the oldest person in the class is
likely to be the only person of that age. Similarly, the youngest
person in the class is also more likely to hold a unique age in
comparison to the rest of the group.

The same thing happens with pitches in melodies. Both the lowest and
highest pitches are less likely to be repeated within a phrase than
pitches closer to the center of the melodic range. In order to make
the claim that high-pitches tend to be unique, one must compensate
for the relatively rarity of extreme values --- which Eitan did not
do. [1]
